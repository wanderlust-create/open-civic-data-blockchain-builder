## Overview

By building Open Civic Data like as an immutable append-only event log, we can better enable a number of things.

Both our data sources ([openstates](https://github.com/openstates/openstates-scrapers) and [councilmatic](https://github.com/datamade/chicago-council-scrapers)), expose things in the open civic data format. So making our model be backwards compatible with opencivicdata would make interop and chance of adoption by other orgs more likely.

- Publish to All Social Media: P2P social media is built on blockchain tech. By having events, we can easily publish updates to different automated feeds across BlueSky, Mastadon, etc.
- For WindyCivi client app: Our client app can sync just updated info, which will allow Windy Civi to better serve push, and be a Web3 app.
- AI Workflows: Our future AI workflows can easily just iterate over the event logs.

### Prior art/reading:
- [Washington DC made Github](https://github.com/DCCouncil/law-xml) their official law source of truth. It looks immutable.
- [How append-only logs are used in p2p/blockchain applications](https://scuttlebot.io/more/protocols/secure-scuttlebutt.html).

### OpenStates Specific Info

We can get OpenStates data 2 ways
- [via SQL Dump](https://open.pluralpolicy.com/data/), which updates every few days, and has bill full text, in addition to a lot of other content like maps data.
- [By running the scrapers directly](https://github.com/openstates/openstates-scrapers) Data will be much more up to date as it scrapes data directly.

## Potential Folder Structure + Filename Convention

```
ocd-jurisdiction
	/country:us
		/state:fl/government
			/sessions
				/session-214
					/bills
						/HB250
								vote_event_{timestamp}.json
								bill_event_somenamingconvetion.json
								bill_event_somenamingconvetion.json
					/votes
						hb250/
			/events
```				

### Other Events To Consider

```
// bill.actions
// bill.sponsorships
// bill.versions
// bill.scrape_correction
  // the scraper got messsed up and we need to update some old data.
```

### How to handle metadata changes

The metadata in `bill` can change scrape over scrape. We can use the fieldMask method here for keeping events small.

```
// bill.metadata_events
{
    fieldMask: ["from_organization"]
    bill: {
        from_organization: ""
    }
}
```

## TODO

- [ ] Make a scraper that can take the zip output and convert it into the proposed file/folder structure.
- [ ] Run OpenStates Scraper on more machines
- [ ] Get example OpenStates scraper output for USA, in addition to the IL we already have.

##  To Discover: Unique IDs
Finding id's for entities that we can use to easily find links in other datasets. Many ids in the output are UUIDs generated by the DB, and not based on any naming convention or gov given ID.

`bill.identifier` - This ID should be given by the government, so should be reliable.
