Provides that a public utility shall ensure that it has the necessary labor force in order to fulfill its duties under the Act. Provides that no substantial change shall be made by any public utility in its labor force unless the public utility provides notice to the Illinois Commerce Commission at least 45 days before the implementation of the change. Provides that a public utility shall provide a report to the Commission in addition to the notice of the substantial change. Sets forth requirements for the content of the report. Provides that the Commission may conduct an audit or investigation of any public utility report filed pursuant to provisions concerning a public utility's labor force.
