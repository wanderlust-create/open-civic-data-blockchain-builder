Provides that the Department of Transportation shall adopt rules specifying the standards for registration of certain signs under the Act. Adds the failure of the Department to act upon any permit within the designated time limit under the Act or the rules adopted by the Department to reasons a person can appeal a decision by the Department. Provides that a hearing for an appeal shall commence within 30 days after the receipt of the appeal request. Adds requirements for a hearing conducted under the Act and requires an administrative law judge to present a written proposal that contains findings of fact, conclusions of law, and recommendations for a final decision to the Secretary of Transportation within 30 days after conclusion of a hearing. Adopts and incorporates the Illinois Administrative Procedure Act.
