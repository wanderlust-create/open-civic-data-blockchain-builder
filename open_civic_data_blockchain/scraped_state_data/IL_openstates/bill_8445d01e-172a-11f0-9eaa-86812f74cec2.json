Provides that the Illinois Commerce Commission shall not issue any certificate of authority under the Act before July 1, 2026. Removes language providing that if, after July 1, 2026, the Pipeline and Hazardous Materials Safety Administration has not adopted final revisions to specified pipeline safety rules, the Commission may only approve a certificate of authority if it finds that the applicant has met all of the requirements of the Act, has already acquired all of its other necessary approvals, and is compliant with any requirements or conditions adopted by the Commission. Provides that a nonconsenting pore space owner's compensation shall include just compensation and any operations term or injection term payments made upon or after the initiation of injection provided to consenting pore space owners in consideration of allowing use of their pore space for sequestration of carbon dioxide. Provides that a nonconsenting pore space owner's compensation shall be no less than the average total payment package, considered as a whole with respect to an individual owner, provided in agreements to similarly situated consenting pore space owners for use of their pore space by the same sequestration operator for the same sequestration project (instead of provided in agreements during the previous 365 days to similarly situated consenting pore space owners). Amends the Safety and Aid for the Environment in Carbon Capture and Sequestration Act. Provides that an affected landowner is entitled to reasonable compensation from an applicant that has been granted a certificate of authority under this Act for damages resulting from access to the landowner's property for required activities taken to construct the pipeline, including, but not limited to, compensation for specified damages. Sets forth provisions concerning payment of the compensation; attorney's fees; and an applicant entering into an agreement with the Department of Agriculture that governs the mitigation of agricultural impacts associated with the construction of the proposed pipeline.
