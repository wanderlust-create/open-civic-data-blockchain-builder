Provides that when an insured person or policyholder requests, in writing, from the insurance issuer a confirmation of the current outstanding balance due from the insured person or policyholder, the insurance issuer may charge a fee of no more than $40 to provide that information. Requires the fee to be reasonably related to the work and time required to confirm the total balance owed. Sets forth requirements that must be met before an insurance issuer may turn an outstanding balance over to a collection agent, including requiring a written communication to the insured person or policyholder from whom money is owed, requiring the insurer to allow the insured person or policyholder 7 calendar days after receipt of the written communication to either confirm receipt of the written communication and agree to pay or to request a different time frame, and the insurer to attempt in good faith to agree on a time frame for all outstanding moneys owed to be paid. Provides that if an agreement to pay is not reached within 7 calendar days after receipt of the written notice or payment is not made by the agreed-upon time frame, the insurance issuer may turn the delinquent account over to a collection agent."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
