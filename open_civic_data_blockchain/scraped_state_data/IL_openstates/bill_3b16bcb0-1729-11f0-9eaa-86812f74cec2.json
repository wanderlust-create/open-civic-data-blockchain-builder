Adds a Diversion of Unfit Misdemeanants Article to the Code. Provides that a defendant charged with one or more misdemeanors and for whom a court has determined that a bona fide doubt of the defendant's fitness has been raised may be admitted into an unfit misdemeanant diversion program only upon the approval of the court. Provides that the Illinois Supreme Court or any circuit court of the State may adopt rules establishing unfit misdemeanant diversion programs consistent with the Article. Provides that the court shall require an eligibility screening and an assessment of the defendant to determine whether the defendant may be able to receive mental health services under the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code which shall reasonably assure his or her safety and that of the public and his or her continued participation in treatment. Provides that if, following this screening, the State and the defendant agree to the diversion and the court determines that the defendant is appropriate for diversion, the criminal charges may be dismissed with prejudice. Provides that if the court does not approve, the court shall order a fitness examination and the matter shall be governed by any other relevant provisions of the Fitness for Trial, To Plead, or to be Sentenced Article of the Code. Provides that the misdemeanant diversion program may maintain or collaborate with mental health and substance use treatment providers necessary to provide a continuum of treatment options commensurate with the needs of the defendant and available resources. Treatment programs shall comply with all relevant statutes and rules. Requires the Department of Human Services to provide care to persons determined to be subject to involuntary admission on an inpatient basis as defined in the Mental Health and Developmental Disabilities Code or may make arrangements with any other appropriate inpatient mental health facility to provide those services.
