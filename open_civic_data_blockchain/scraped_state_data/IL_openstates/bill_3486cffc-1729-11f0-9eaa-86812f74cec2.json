Provides that unreliable statements to law enforcement made during a custodial interrogation conducted at a police station or other place of detention by a defendant are inadmissible at trial in any criminal court proceeding or juvenile court proceeding for the prosecution of a homicide. Provides that in any proceeding under this provision, the prosecution shall timely disclose prior to any relevant evidentiary hearing or trial its intent to introduce a statement made during a custodial interrogation conducted at a place of detention. Provides that at that time, the prosecution must tender any electronic recordings of the statement and any documents relating to the circumstances under which the statement was obtained and any other evidence the State intends to rely upon to determine the statement's reliability. Provides that before trial, a defendant may move to exclude a statement alleged to be unreliable. Provides that the defendant shall specifically identify the statement or statements alleged to be unreliable. Provides that at the hearing, it shall be the burden of the prosecutor to prove by a preponderance of the evidence that the statement is reliable. Provides that when deciding a statement's reliability, a court should consider: (1) whether the details in the statement fit with the evidence known before the interrogation, especially details that describe unusual or not easily guessed facts of the crime that had not been made public; (2) whether the statement provides any new details or any new evidence not known before the interrogation that can be independently corroborated after the interrogation; (3) whether facts of the crime were disclosed to the defendant rather than originated with the defendant; (4) whether the defendant recanted the defendant's statement at any time and the circumstances of that recantation; (5) whether the statement was electronically recorded; and (6) any other information relevant to the reliability of the statement."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
