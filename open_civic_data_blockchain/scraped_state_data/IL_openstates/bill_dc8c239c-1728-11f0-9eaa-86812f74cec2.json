Provides that a park owner is prohibited from requiring a tenant to pay for utility service in which the public utility company charging for those services includes any service to common areas, other mobile homes, areas used or occupied by persons other than the individual tenant, and persons occupying the same mobile home with the tenant. Provides that a park owner may not request or cause a change in billing in metered utilities during the term of a lease (i) from a tenant to the park owner or landlord or (ii) from the park owner to a tenant. Requires the park owner to provide a minimum of 90 days' notice to each affected tenant before changing the service but no less than 90 days before the expiration of a lease. Allows the park owner and tenant to agree to amend the lease to effect such a change as long as the amendment is in writing and signed by both parties. Provides that any term or condition in a rental agreement between the park owner and the tenant that is inconsistent with the Act is void and unenforceable. Requires park owners to provide detailed copies of monthly utility bills to tenants for utilities paid by the park owner regardless of the metering arrangement."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
