The bill creates a facility provider fee enterprise support board within CHASE for the purpose of supporting the existing enterprise with the implementation of the healthcare affordability and sustainability nursing facility provider fee and the healthcare affordability and sustainability intermediate care facility fee. In exchange for payment of the healthcare affordability and sustainability nursing facility provider fee, CHASE will provide certain business services to nursing facility providers to sustain or increase reimbursement rates and make supplemental medicaid payments to nursing facility providers. In exchange for payment of the healthcare affordability and sustainability intermediate care facility fee, CHASE will provide certain business services to intermediate care facility providers for individuals with intellectual disabilities for the purposes of maintaining the quality and continuity of services provided by intermediate care facilities for individuals with intellectual disabilities. Because CHASE is an enterprise for purposes of the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, its revenue does not count against the state fiscal year spending limit.\nThe bill also makes conforming amendments and, for clarity, renames the existing healthcare affordability and sustainability fee and healthcare affordability and sustainability fund to be the healthcare affordability and sustainability hospital provider fee and the healthcare affordability and sustainability hospital provider fee cash fund.\n For the 2025-26 state fiscal year, $62,986,221 is appropriated from the healthcare affordability and sustainability nursing facility provider fee cash fund to HCPF and $2,150,281 is appropriated from the healthcare affordability and sustainability intermediate care facility fee cash fund to HCPF. The bill also decreases in corresponding amounts appropriations to HCPF from other cash funds and modifies appropriations to HCPF for the 2024-25 state fiscal year.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Governor Signed", "date": "2025-04-30T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-signature"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Consideration of First Conference Committee Report result was to Adopt Committee Report -
