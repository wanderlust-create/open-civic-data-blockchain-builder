The bill clarifies that a dealer that does not comply with the registration requirements is subject to a fine of $200 per instance of noncompliance. The bill also explicitly authorizes the parks and wildlife commission to adopt rules concerning the enforcement of the registration requirements of off-highway vehicles.\nUnder current law, proof of ownership is required for the registration of an off-highway vehicle. The bill removes this requirement so that an individual registering their off-highway vehicle no longer has to provide the division of parks and wildlife with proof of ownership for the off-highway vehicle.\n\nThe bill amends certain provisions related to the off-highway vehicle recreation fund (fund) to clarify what the money in the fund shall be used for. The bill also specifies that money remaining in the fund at the end of a given fiscal year shall remain in the fund and only be used for specific purposes related to the use of off-highway vehicles in Colorado.\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Senate Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Postpone Indefinitely", "date": "2025-01-30T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Agriculture & Natural Resources", "date": "2025-01-08T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Agriculture & Natural Resources", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Scott Bright", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Scott Bright\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "Introduced (01/08/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_021_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Committee Amendment", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2025a_sb021_s_agr_001.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [{"note": "Fiscal Note FN1 (01/21/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_sb021_00.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25-021", "note": ""}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:co/government", "name": "Colorado", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:co"}, "scraped_at": "2025-05-21T00:15:49+00:00", "_id": "bf53ddd2-35d8-11f0-8e0b-32d15865c953"}
