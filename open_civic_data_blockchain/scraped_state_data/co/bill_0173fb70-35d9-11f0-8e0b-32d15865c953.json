Because manufacture or distribution of any amount of a qualifying controlled substance is a level 1 drug felony under the bill, the bill repeals penalty level provisions involving manufacture or distribution of a qualifying controlled substance that are weight- or circumstance-dependent, and related immunity and sentencing requirements.\nEffective July 1, 2025, the bill makes the possession of a qualifying controlled substance a level 4 drug felony. The bill repeals the following provisions of law related to the penalties for possessing a qualifying controlled substance:\n\n\nA provision that reduces the penalty if the fact finder in the case finds that the possessor made a reasonable mistake of fact and did not know that the material, compound, mixture, or preparation contained fentanyl, carfentanil, benzimidazole opiate, or an analog thereof; and\nA provision that requires a court to vacate the drug felony conviction and enter a conviction for a level 1 drug misdemeanor upon the defendant's successful completion of a community-based sentence to probation or to a community corrections program.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Senate Committee on Judiciary Postpone Indefinitely", "date": "2025-02-10T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "Judiciary", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Judiciary", "date": "2025-01-08T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Judiciary", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Byron Pelton", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Byron Pelton\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Ryan Armagost", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Ryan Armagost\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "Introduced (01/08/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_044_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Committee Amendment", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2025a_sb044_s_jud_001.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [{"note": "Fiscal Note FN1 (02/05/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_sb044_00.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25-044", "note": ""}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:co/government", "name": "Colorado", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:co"}, "scraped_at": "2025-05-21T00:17:39+00:00", "_id": "0173fb70-35d9-11f0-8e0b-32d15865c953"}
