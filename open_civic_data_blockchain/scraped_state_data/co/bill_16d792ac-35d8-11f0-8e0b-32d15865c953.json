{"legislative_session": "2025A", "identifier": "SB25-321", "title": "Motor Vehicle Emissions Inspection Facilities", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": [], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Under current law, the state contracts to conduct emissions testing. Current law also sets limits on how long the contracts may run. The bill repeals these limits and authorizes the division of administration in the department of public health and environment (division) to determine the length of each contract. Current law also authorizes a vehicle emissions inspection facility to charge a fee that is set by the air quality control commission (commission), but the fee is capped at $25 for model year 1982 and newer vehicles and $15 for model year 1981 and older vehicles. The bill authorizes the commission to adopt rules adjusting this fee limit, but the commission is limited to adjusting:\n\n\nThe $15 maximum fee to $30 when a licensed inspection and readjustment station inspects vehicles model year 1981 and older; and\nThe $25 maximum fee to $50 for a clean screen inspection performed on vehicles registered in the basic emissions program.  that are model year 1982 and newer.\n\n\nThe commission may adopt rules requiring the emissions compliance of vehicles that have failed an emissions test and that are registered outside of the program area but that operate within the program area.\n\nThe bill requires the commission to adopt rules requiring inspections of motor vehicles that are registered in the nonattainment area and identified as having excess emissions under the clean screen program and are either within the 2-year vehicle inspection cycle or exempt from periodic inspection.\n\nIf a motor vehicle's emissions control system has been disconnected, deactivated, or rendered inoperable, the division may notify the executive director of the department of revenue.\n\nUnder current law, fines and penalties assessed for violations of air quality laws are deposited in the community impact cash fund. The bill creates a motor vehicle emissions assistance fund (fund) and diverts the first $1 million from the community impact cash fund to the new fund, but at the end of each state fiscal year, any unspent money in the fund exceeding $250,000 is returned to the community impact cash fund.\n\nThe division may expend money from the fund to provide grants for:\n\n\nPaying emissions inspection fees for motor vehicles registered to individuals participating in an established and recognized public assistance program; or\nAdjustments or emissions-related repairs that are necessary and sufficient to receive a certification of emissions compliance.\n\nQualification standards are set for the grants. The division may accept and expend gifts, grants, and donations. The money in the fund is continuously appropriated. To implement the bill, $5,674 is transferred from the AIR account of the highway users tax fund to the Colorado DRIVES vehicle services account of the fund. The fine money is declared to be damages and except from the expenditure caps of the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-05-07T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Special Order - Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-05-06T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Committee on Appropriations Refer Unamended to House Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-05-06T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "House Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Appropriations", "date": "2025-05-05T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Third Reading Passed with Amendments - Floor", "date": "2025-05-05T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Special Order - Passed with Amendments - Committee", "date": "2025-05-02T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Appropriations Refer Unamended - Consent Calendar to Senate Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-05-02T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Finance Refer Amended to Appropriations", "date": "2025-05-01T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Transportation & Energy Refer Unamended to Finance", "date": "2025-04-30T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Transportation & Energy", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Transportation & Energy", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Transportation & Energy", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Barbara Kirkmeyer", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Barbara Kirkmeyer\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Robert Rodriguez", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Robert Rodriguez\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Junie Joseph", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Junie Joseph\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Ryan Gonzalez", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Ryan Gonzalez\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "J.
