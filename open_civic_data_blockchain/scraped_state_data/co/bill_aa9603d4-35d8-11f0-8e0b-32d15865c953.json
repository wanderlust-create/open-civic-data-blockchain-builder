{"legislative_session": "2025A", "identifier": "HB25-1157", "title": "Reauthorize Advanced Industries Tax Credit", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": [], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Currently, the advanced industry investment tax credit (credit) expires on December 31, 2026. The bill extends the credit until December 31, 2031. The credit is currently available to a qualified investor that makes a qualified investment in a qualified small business that is in an advanced industry. On and after January 1, 2028, the credit is also available to a qualified investor that makes a qualified investment in a qualified small business that is not an advanced industry business, operates in the manufacturing sector, generates revenue from operations, is a primary employer, is producing a product that is distributed outside of Colorado, and, in the judgment of the Colorado office of economic development (office), is a commercially scalable and capital-intensive business that will bring incremental income to the local economy.\nThe bill changes the definition of \"qualified investment\" by eliminating the current prohibition against a qualified investor having more than 30% of the voting power in the qualified small business before the investor makes a qualified investment and more than 49% of the voting power in the qualified small business after making a qualified investment.\n\nThe bill changes the definition of \"qualified investor\" by clarifying that an entity subject to income tax may qualify as an investor, except that a C corporation, including any limited liability or other legal entity treated as a C corporation for federal and state income tax purposes, is not a qualified investor. A qualified investor may include a partner, shareholder, or beneficiary that is allocated a credit. A qualified investor does not include a person that had control of a qualified small business for 6 months preceding or following the date of the investment in the qualified small business. A founder, employee, or contractor or a spouse of a founder, employee, or contractor of a qualified small business is not a qualified investor. A person that has invested more than $50,000 in the qualified small business or owns more than 10% of the qualified small business on a fully diluted basis is not a qualified investor.\n\nThe office administers the credit. The office may certify a small business as a qualified small business until October 1, 2031. A small business certified as a qualified small business must report to the office as requested to confirm the certified small business's status as a qualified small business. The office may require a qualified small business to provide information to confirm that a qualified investment has been made in the qualified small business, the intended use of the qualified investment, and the expected number of new employees that will be hired by the qualified small business as a result of the qualified investment. A qualified small business that receives a qualified investment is required to report data relevant to the impact of the credit and development of the qualified small business annually to the office for 5 years following a qualified investment. The office may assess a penalty against a qualified small business that does not meet this reporting requirement.\n\nThe office may issue $4 million in credits per calendar year for the years through the 2026 calendar year for which the credit is currently available. The bill decreases the cap to $2.5 million per calendar year beginning with the 2027 calendar year through the 2031 calendar year.\n\nIf the qualified investor receiving a credit is a trust, the qualified investor may allocate the credit between the trust and its beneficiaries in any manner determined by the trust. The office shall issue a credit certificate to a trust beneficiary and a trust beneficiary may claim the amount indicated on the credit certificate.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Governor Signed", "date": "2025-05-19T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-signature"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-07T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-07T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-07T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-05-05T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Special Order - Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-05-02T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Appropriations Refer Unamended - Consent Calendar to Senate Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-05-02T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Finance Refer Unamended to Appropriations", "date": "2025-05-01T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Finance", "date": "2025-04-30T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "House Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-30T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Special Order - Passed with Amendments - Floor", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Committee on Appropriations Refer Unamended to House Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "House Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "House Committee on Finance Refer Unamended to Appropriations", "date": "2025-02-06T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Finance", "date": "2025-01-29T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Brianna Titone", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Brianna Titone\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "William Lindstedt", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"William Lindstedt\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Marc Snyder", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Marc Snyder\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Mark Baisley", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Mark Baisley\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "J.
