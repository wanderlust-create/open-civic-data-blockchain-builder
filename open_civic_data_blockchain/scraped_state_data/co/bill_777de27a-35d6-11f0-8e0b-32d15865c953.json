Section 3 of the bill permits bridges court liaisons to access juvenile competency evaluations and related information.\nCurrent law sets forth procedures for court determinations of a juvenile's competency in juvenile justice proceedings. Section 4 of the bill requires a court to dismiss the case against a juvenile if the court makes a final determination that the juvenile is incompetent to proceed and the juvenile's highest charged act is a class 2 misdemeanor, a petty offense, a drug misdemeanor, or a traffic offense.\nUnder current law, one year after a court finds a juvenile charged with a level 4 drug felony is incompetent to proceed the court shall enter a finding the juvenile is unrestorable to competency and shall determine whether a management plan is necessary for the juvenile. The bill reduces the time from one year to 6 months.\n\nThe bill imposes certain limitations on a case management plan's contents in cases that involve sexual conduct and addresses court responses when a juvenile or a juvenile's parent or guardian fails to engage with a management plan's ordered services.\n Section 5 of the bill requires that a person sentenced for a delinquent act committed as a juvenile receive credit for any period of confinement prior to sentencing. Section 6 of the bill creates the deflection and community investment grant program (grant program) in the office of adult and juvenile justice assistance in the division of criminal justice to provide grants to eligible nonprofit and tribal applicants to implement a mixed-delivery system of trauma-informed health and development deflection programs for youth, including Native American youth.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Senate Committee on Appropriations Lay Over Unamended - Amendment(s) Failed", "date": "2025-05-08T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Judiciary Refer Amended to Appropriations", "date": "2025-02-24T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Judiciary", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Judiciary", "date": "2025-01-08T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Judiciary", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Dafna Michaelson Jenet", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Dafna Michaelson Jenet\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Judy Amabile", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Judy Amabile\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Mary Bradfield", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Mary Bradfield\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Regina English", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Regina English\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "L.
