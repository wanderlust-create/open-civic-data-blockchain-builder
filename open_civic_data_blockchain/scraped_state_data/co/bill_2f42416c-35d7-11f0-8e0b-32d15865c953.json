The energy and carbon management commission (commission) collects the stewardship fee on the enterprise's behalf. All money collected as stewardship fees is credited to the geologic storage stewardship enterprise cash fund, which is created in the bill. Money in the geologic storage stewardship enterprise cash fund is continuously appropriated to the enterprise.\n\nThe enterprise and the commission may each adopt rules to implement the bill.\n\nUpon the commission's approval of a site closure:\n\n\nOwnership of the injection carbon dioxide, and ownership of any remaining facilities used to inject or store injection carbon dioxide, transfer to the state without payment of additional compensation;\nExcept in specified circumstances, the geologic storage operator is released from all regulatory liability associated with the continued storage of the injection carbon dioxide and the long-term stewardship of the associated geologic storage facility; and\nThe enterprise undertakes long-term stewardship of the injection carbon dioxide and any associated geologic storage facility.\n\n\nThe bill makes several updates to laws concerning the administration of underground geothermal resources, including:\n\n\nClarifying that \"nontributary groundwater\" does not include \"designated groundwater\", as these terms are defined in current law;\nExempting certain geothermal operations from needing a well permit from the state engineer;\nRequiring the state engineer to notify the operator of a prior geothermal operation of an application for a proposed well, and allowing the operator the opportunity to request a hearing if the application causes concern for material injury to the prior geothermal operation;\nEstablishing that the authority to regulate shallow geothermal operations is shared by the state engineer and the state board of examiners;\nRenaming the state board of examiners of water well construction and pump installation contractors as the \"state board of examiners of water well and ground heat exchanger contractors\" (state board of examiners); and\nRegulating ground heat exchanger contractors in the same manner that currently exists for water well construction contractors and pump installation contractors.\n\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Considered Senate Amendments - Result was to Concur - Repass", "date": "2025-04-11T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Considered Senate Amendments - Result was to Laid Over Daily", "date": "2025-04-06T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-04T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Special Order - Passed with Amendments - Committee", "date": "2025-04-03T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Transportation & Energy Refer Amended to Senate Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-03-31T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Senate Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Transportation & Energy", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Transportation & Energy", "date": "2025-03-19T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Transportation & Energy", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "House Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-03-14T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Special Order - Passed with Amendments - Committee, Floor", "date": "2025-03-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Laid Over Daily - No Amendments", "date": "2025-03-04T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Committee on Energy & Environment Refer Amended to House Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-02-27T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "House Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Energy & Environment", "date": "2025-02-03T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Energy & Environment", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Amy Paschal", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Amy Paschal\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Matt Soper", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Matt Soper\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Cleave Simpson", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Cleave Simpson\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Cathy Kipp", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Cathy Kipp\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "S.
