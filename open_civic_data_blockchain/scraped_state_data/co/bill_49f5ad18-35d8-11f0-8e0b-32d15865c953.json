{"legislative_session": "2025A", "identifier": "HB25-1136", "title": "Peace Officer Conduct Database", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": [], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Law enforcement is required to report to the peace officers standards and training board (P.O.S.T. board) certain information related to peace officer conduct for inclusion in a searchable database. The bill requires the head of the law enforcement agency providing the report to certify the accuracy of the information in the report. The agency providing the report shall provide the P.O.S.T. board with all documents relevant to the discipline for which the officer was placed in the database upon request of the P.O.S.T. board. If a law enforcement agency refuses to provide the records, the P.O.S.T. board may subpoena the records. If the court grants the subpoena, the court shall may order the law enforcement agency to pay the P.O.S.T. board's attorney fees, costs, and fees related to the subpoena. The bill prohibits the P.O.S.T. board from including information in the database if the information is received from an agency that does not employ or has not employed the subject of the information. If an agency fails to report the information, the agency is subject to a fine or loss of P.O.S.T. board funding .\nA peace officer who is included in the searchable database can appeal the officer's inclusion in the database. When a peace officer is added to the database, the P.O.S.T. board shall provide the peace officer with information about how to appeal that action on its website . The bill requires the peace officer's disciplining law enforcement agency to provide the P.O.S.T. board with all documents relevant to the discipline for which the officer was placed in the database. If a law enforcement agency refuses to provide the records, the P.O.S.T. board may subpoena the records. If the court grants the subpoena, the court shall  may order the law enforcement agency to pay the P.O.S.T. board's attorney fees, costs, and fees related to the subpoena.\nThe bill gives the P.O.S.T. board director the authority to remove entries from the database that are in error.\nUnder current law, the P.O.S.T. board shall permanently revoke a peace officer's certification and record that information in the database if the officer is found civilly liable for the use of unlawful physical force or is found civilly liable for failure to intervene in the use of unlawful force and the incident resulted in serious bodily injury or death to another person. The bill gives the P.O.S.T. board the discretion to permanently revoke in those cases.\n\nIf a law enforcement agency is investigating a peace officer for an incident that could result in a database report, the law enforcement agency shall inform the peace officer of the agency's duty to report that information and the consequences of the reporting.\n\nThe bill prohibits a law enforcement agency from agreeing to a settlement with a peace officer that includes the agency agreeing to not report the information to the database.\n\nCurrent law requires a law enforcement agency to provide a peace officer's personnel records when they receive a waiver for the records to another law enforcement agency that is considering employing the peace officer. A law enforcement agency or governmental agency that submits the waiver to another agency and does not receive the records shall report that fact to the P.O.S.T. board. The P.O.S.T. board shall may contact the agency, and if the agency does not provide the disclosure within 6 calendar days, the P.O.S.T. board shall not provide the agency with P.O.S.T. board funding for a period of one year and the agency may be subject to fines.\nThe bill allows a person to maintain their P.O.S.T. certification if they are not working as a peace officer but are working for a law enforcement agency in a non-peace-officer role and they maintain the annual P.O.S.T. board training requirements .\nIn 2024, the general assembly provided temporary peace officer status to administrators of judicial security. The bill makes the status permanent.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Considered Senate Amendments -
