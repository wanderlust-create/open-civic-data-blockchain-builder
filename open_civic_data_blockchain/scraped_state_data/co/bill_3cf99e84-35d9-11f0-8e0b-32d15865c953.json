and\nUpdating the application process required for seeking approval of an economic development rate by requiring that the commission:\nApprove or deny an application within 120 days after a notice period of 14 business days after the application was filed ; except that if the load is more than 150 megawatts, the commission shall approve or deny the application within 210 days after the notice period ; and\nConsider the broader economic benefits associated with the application for other classes of utility customers and for the surrounding community.\n\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary;
