First, the bill removes the limit on the amounts included in the issuance or incurrence of certain financial obligations by the state that the state treasurer credits to the fund. Second, the bill modifies the fund so that bond counsel approval is no longer needed before money in the fund is used to reimburse the state treasurer for certain verifiable costs. Section 2 allows the state treasurer to use a security token offering for state capital financing and adopt rules as necessary to do so. Section 3 creates a new special purpose authority: The building urgent infrastructure and leveraging dollars authority (authority). The authority's primary purpose is to finance certain infrastructure projects that are ready for construction or commencement. As used in this context, an infrastructure project is a project that includes, but is not limited to, the development, construction, repair, improvement, operation, maintenance, decommissioning, or ownership of: A transportation infrastructure project, an infrastructure project in a transit-oriented community, a county courthouse facility, a  transportation facility; utility infrastructure; renewable energy infrastructure; recycling infrastructure; energy efficiency infrastructure; an education facility; water infrastructure; affordable and accessible housing stock infrastructure ; or digital, social, or other infrastructure related to economic development.\nThe powers of the authority are vested in a 9-member 11-member board with the following membership:\n\n\nThe state treasurer or the state treasurer's designee;\nThe state architect or the state architect's designee;\nThe chair of the capital development committee of the general assembly or any successor committee;\nA member of the capital development committee of the general assembly or any successor committee who is the longest serving member on the committee and who is a member of the major political party other than the party of the chair of the committee;\nA representative of local governments;\nA representative of a statewide organization of general and specialty commercial construction contractors, appointed by the governor;\nA representative of a statewide employee organization representing building and construction trade workers, appointed by the president of the senate;\nAn individual representing service employees;\nAn individual with a background in finance who has experience with pension fund management, appointed by the state treasurer; and\nAn individual with a background in finance who has experience with bonds, appointed by the state treasurer; and\nAn individual with a background in commercial lending representing an institution insured by the deposit insurance corporation.\n\nThe state treasurer or the state treasurer's designee shall serve as the chair and shall call the first meeting of the board no later than January 1, 2026.\n\nAmong other powers, the authority may:\n\n\nMake and execute agreements, contracts, and other instruments as necessary to achieve the authority's purposes, including contracting with the officers, personnel, and consultants of the state treasurer to achieve its purposes;\nCharge to and collect from state agencies and persons fees and charges in connection with the authority's loans or other services;\nIssue and sell building urgent infrastructure and leveraging dollars bonds, payable solely from the building urgent infrastructure and leveraging dollars bonding fund created within the authority;\nInvest and deposit money; and\nFinance or participate in the financing of eligible projects or any interest in such a project.\n\n\nThe infrastructure and long-term development assistance program (program) is created in the authority to allow for the authority to provide financing for eligible projects. The bill requires the authority to develop policies and procedures necessary to implement the program. At a minimum, the policies and procedures must specify application criteria, an application process, and a selection process for the authority to determine which eligible projects it will finance or assist in financing through the program. The authority shall pay for such financing out of the eligible project revolving fund created in the authority.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-02T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-02T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-01T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Considered House Amendments - Result was to Concur - Repass", "date": "2025-04-28T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-25T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Special Order - Passed with Amendments - Committee", "date": "2025-04-24T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Committee on Finance Refer Amended to House Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-04-21T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "House Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Finance", "date": "2025-03-12T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-03-12T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Passed with Amendments - Floor", "date": "2025-03-11T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["reading-2"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Appropriations Refer Unamended to Senate Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-03-07T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Senate Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Finance Refer Amended to Appropriations", "date": "2025-02-18T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Finance", "date": "2025-01-23T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Jeff Bridges", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Jeff Bridges\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Judy Amabile", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Judy Amabile\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Shannon Bird", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Shannon Bird\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Emily Sirota", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Emily Sirota\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "M.
