Section 2 of the bill authorizes the authority to conduct the study on a recurring basis and requires the authority to present a statewide transmission plan, based on the results of the study, to the Colorado public utilities commission (commission) and the legislature every 3 years, beginning on or before September 1, 2027. Section 2 requires the authority to consider advanced transmission technologies in the study and identify certain projects that use advanced transmission technologies. \"Advanced transmission technologies\" is defined in section 1 as hardware or software technologies that increase the capacity, efficiency, reliability, or resiliency of an existing or new transmission facility. Section 3 designates the authority as a statewide transmission coordinator. Among other duties, the authority is required to facilitate coordinated statewide planning; engage with regional and interregional planning processes; and establish an expert advisory panel to review and provide feedback on model inputs, assumptions, and approaches.\nUnder current law, an electric utility must submit an electric resource plan to the commission for approval. Sections 4 and 5 require an electric utility to:\n\n\nInclude in the electric resource plan a transmission plan that identifies certain transmission resources and projects;\nIncorporate in the electric resource plan an evaluation of advanced transmission technologies or submit to the commission an explanation of why advanced transmission technologies are not included in the electric resource plan; and\nProvide model inputs and assumptions and other system information or methodology consultation necessary to support the authority in acting as a statewide transmission coordinator.\n\n Section 4 allows the commission to design incentives for a retail electric utility that utilizes advanced transmission technologies. Section 6 requires an electric utility to consider advanced transmission technologies in the electric utility's 10-year transmission plan.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Senate Second Reading Laid Over to 05/08/2025 - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-17T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Laid Over to 04/17/2025 - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-11T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Laid Over to 04/11/2025 - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-09T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Laid Over to 04/09/2025 - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-07T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Laid Over to 04/07/2025 - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-04T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Laid Over to 04/04/2025 - No Amendments", "date": "2025-03-31T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Transportation & Energy Refer Amended to Senate Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-03-26T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Senate Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Transportation & Energy", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Transportation & Energy", "date": "2025-02-05T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Transportation & Energy", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Cleave Simpson", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Cleave Simpson\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Dylan Roberts", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Dylan Roberts\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "Introduced (02/05/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_127_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "PA1 (03/27/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_127_s_tra_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Committee Amendment", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2025a_sb127_s_tra_001.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [{"note": "Fiscal Note FN2 (03/28/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_sb127_r1.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Fiscal Note FN1 (03/07/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_sb127_00.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25-127", "note": ""}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:co/government", "name": "Colorado", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:co"}, "scraped_at": "2025-05-21T00:12:19+00:00", "_id": "4275519c-35d8-11f0-8e0b-32d15865c953"}
