{"legislative_session": "2025A", "identifier": "SB25-228", "title": "Enterprise Disability Buy-in Premiums", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": [], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Joint Budget Committee. Under current law, there are 2 programs available to low-income individuals to buy in to the state medical assistance program: One for adults with disabilities and one for children with disabilities (medicaid buy-in programs). Individuals who participate in either program pay a premium based on their family income. The premiums are credited to the medicaid buy-in cash fund. The premiums credited to the medicaid buy-in cash fund are used to offset the costs of providing the medicaid buy-in programs. The costs of providing the medicaid buy-in programs are also offset by the money in the healthcare affordability and sustainability fee cash fund in the Colorado healthcare affordability and sustainability enterprise (CHASE) within the department of health care policy and financing (HCPF).\nThe bill repeals the existing medicaid buy-in cash fund and creates the healthcare affordability and sustainability medicaid buy-in cash fund (buy-in cash fund) within CHASE and directs that individuals who participate in the existing medicaid buy-in programs pay their premiums into the buy-in cash fund. The bill creates a medicaid buy-in enterprise support board within CHASE to support the existing enterprise with the implementation of the medicaid buy-in program, including consulting with HCPF and the state medical services board on the amount of the premiums for and other components of the medicaid buy-in programs. Because CHASE is an enterprise for purposes of the Taxpayer's Bill of Rights, its revenue does not count against the state fiscal year spending limit.\n\nThe bill also makes conforming amendments.\n For the 2025-26 state fiscal year, $6,660,761 is appropriated from the buy-in cash fund to HCPF for medical and long-term care services for medicaid-eligible individuals. The bill also decreases in a corresponding amount an appropriation to HCPF from the existing Medicaid buy-in cash fund and adjusts similar appropriations to HCPF for the 2024-25 state fiscal year.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Governor Signed", "date": "2025-05-30T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-signature"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Consideration of First Conference Committee Report result was to Adopt Committee Report -
