The bill gives the independent ethics commission jurisdiction to hear complaints, issue findings, assess penalties, and issue advisory opinions on ethics issues concerning a special district official or employee or school district official or employee. However:\n\n\n\"Officials\" include only members of a school district or special district board;\n\"School district employee\" includes only the superintendent or head administrative officer designated by a school board to execute its policy decisions who is appointed or hired by, directly reports to, and is subject to the direction of the school district board; and\n\"Special district employee\" includes only an employee of a special district who is appointed or hired by, directly reports to, and is subject to the direction of the special district's board.\n\n\nExisting law establishes ethical standards for a special district official or employee or school district official or employee. The bill incorporates those standards under the independent ethics commission's jurisdiction and expands the standards to include those described in article XXIX of the state constitution.\n\nThe bill appropriates $120,856 in general fund to the judicial department for use by the independent ethics commission for the 2025-26 state fiscal year. To implement the bill, the commission may use $96,917 for program costs and $23,939 for the purchase of legal services. The bill also appropriates $23,939 to the department of law for the 2025-26 state fiscal year. This appropriation is from reappropriated funds received from the bill's appropriation to the judicial department. To implement the bill, the department of law may use this appropriation to provide legal services for the independent ethics commission.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Senate Committee on Appropriations Lay Over Unamended - Amendment(s) Failed", "date": "2025-05-08T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Committee on State, Veterans, & Military Affairs Refer Unamended to Appropriations", "date": "2025-05-01T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "State, Veterans, & Military Affairs", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to State, Veterans, & Military Affairs", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "State, Veterans, & Military Affairs", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "House Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-28T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Special Order - Passed with Amendments - Committee, Floor", "date": "2025-04-25T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Laid Over Daily - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-24T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Committee on Appropriations Refer Amended to House Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-04-22T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "House Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "House Committee on Transportation, Housing & Local Government Refer Amended to Appropriations", "date": "2025-01-29T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Transportation", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Local Government", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Transportation, Housing & Local Government", "date": "2025-01-13T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Transportation, Housing & Local Government", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Transportation", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Local Government", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Tammy Story", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Tammy Story\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Bob Marshall", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Bob Marshall\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Mike Weissman", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Mike Weissman\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "M.
