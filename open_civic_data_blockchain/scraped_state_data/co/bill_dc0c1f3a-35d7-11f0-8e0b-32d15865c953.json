{"legislative_session": "2025A", "identifier": "HB25-1209", "title": "Marijuana Regulation Streamline", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": [], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Current law authorizes the marijuana enforcement division (division) to adopt rules governing records required to be kept by license holders. The bill replaces this with a requirement that the division adopt rules requiring records concerning:\n\n\nChild resistance certificates;\nTesting records;\nRecords demonstrating the composition of raw ingredients used in vaporizers or pressured metered dose inhalers;\nRecall records;\nAdverse health events;\nCorrective action and preventive action records;\nDocumentation required to demonstrate valid responsible vendor designation;\nStandard operating procedures;\nTransfer records of regulated marijuana transactions;\nExpiration date testing and use-by-date testing;\nPatient records; and\nAdvertising records.\n\n\nIf a license holder is required to maintain books and records in the seed-to-sale inventory tracking system, the license holder need not maintain duplicate copies of the books and records. If a license holder is substantially noncompliant with regulatory requirements, the division may require the license holder to maintain additional records. The division must bring an administrative action to require a license holder to maintain additional records.\n\nCurrent law requires occupational license holders to be issued an identification card. The bill authorizes digital identification cards and replaces this requirement with authorization for a requirement that the division to adopt rules governing identification cards requirements, including criminal history record checks for controlling beneficial owners, passive beneficial owners, and individuals who handle or transport regulated marijuana . The bill requires the division to adopt rules authorizing marijuana products manufacturers to use the licensed premises and approved equipment to manufacture and prepare products not infused with regulated marijuana for the purpose of quality control and research and development. Standards are set for the rules.\nCurrent law requires applicants for licensure or renewal to submit fingerprints for a criminal history record check. The bill changes this requirement to require that only controlling beneficial owners and passive beneficial owners must get a fingerprint-based criminal history record check, and the fingerprint-based check is only required for initial licensure; name-based judicial record checks are required for license renewal. Occupational license holders are required to obtain a name-based judicial record check. The division may require an applicant or licensee to obtain a fingerprint-based criminal history record check when there is a demonstrated investigative need. Occupational license applicants are authorized to work while the application is pending.\n\nCurrent law requires the division to adopt rules for security requirements for license holders. The security requirements include video recording requirements. The video recording requirements are changed to require, and must not exceed, video surveillance of the following:\n\n\nEach point of ingress and egress to the exterior of the licensed premises;\nPoints of sale with coverage of the customer or patient and license holder completing the sale;\nAreas of the licensed premises where shipping and receiving of regulated marijuana occurs, test batches are collected, and regulated marijuana waste is destroyed; and\nDelivery vehicles surveillance.\n\nTo obtain video surveillance footage, The division must demand the video surveillance footage in writing within adopt rules that give licensee holders at least 72 hours before the deadline provided after the request to furnish the video surveillance footage.\nCurrent law requires the division to notify license holders by first-class mail of the license expiration date at least 90 days before the expiration. The bill replaces first-class mail with digital communication.\n The bill authorizes medical marijuana stores and retail marijuana stores to host promotions where licensed marijuana producers can offer patient or customer promotional units (promotional unit). To provide a promotional unit, the promotional unit must be:\n\nTested in accordance with the rules of the division;\nTracked with the seed-to-sale inventory tracking system;\nTransferred to the store before the promotion;\nPackaged in accordance with the rules; and \nLabeled in accordance with the rules.\n\nIn addition, the store must:\n\n\nProvide the promotional unit during a promotion;\nVerify that the patient or customer is qualified to receive the promotional unit;\nNot charge a patient or customer for a promotional unit;\nEnsure the total amount of promotional units and purchased medical marijuana that are transferred to a patient or customer do not exceed the legal transfer limits.\n\n\nCurrent law authorizes marijuana cultivation facilities and marijuana products manufacturers to provide research and development units (R-and-D units) to managers and sets standards for the practice. The bill reforms these standards as follows:\n\n\nR-and-D units may be provided to all licensed employees, and the R-and-D unit must be:\nLabeled with the universal symbol indicating that the package contains marijuana, the license number of the facility that produced the R-and-D unit, the batch number, and any required warning statements;\nLabeled to indicate that the R-and-D unit must not be sold or resold;\nTested in accordance with the rules;\nPackaged in a child-resistant container;\nTracked with the seed-to-sale inventory tracking system; and\nProvided for product development or quality control purposes; and\nThe facility or manufacturer may not:\nAllow an R-and-D unit to be consumed on the licensed premises;\nUse an R-and-D unit as a means of compensation;\nProvide R-and-D units in a manner that would violate the law or to an employee who is not qualified;\nRequire an employee to accept or consume an R-and-D unit; or\nReceive compensation for an R-and-D unit.\n\n The amount of marijuana that may be sold in a single transaction at a retail marijuana store is raised from one ounce to 2 ounces or its equivalent in retail marijuana products.\nCurrent law makes it a class 2 misdemeanor for a person to:\n\n\nHave a controlling beneficial ownership, passive beneficial ownership, or indirect financial interest in a license that was not disclosed; and\nEngage in transfer of ownership without prior approval.\n\nThe bill repeals these provisions.\n\nThe bill authorizes the division to set and collect a fee to fulfill requests for copies of a license application. The bill repeals a requirement that retail and medical marijuana products be prepared with equipment that is used exclusively for those products.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-16T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-16T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-16T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Consideration of First Conference Committee Report result was to Adopt Committee Report -
