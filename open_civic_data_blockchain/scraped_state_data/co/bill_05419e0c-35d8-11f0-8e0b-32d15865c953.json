The modifications to the program are:\n\n\nExpanding the requirement to use a substitute address for a program participant from applying only to government agencies to applying to private entities, upon request of the program participant;\nRemoving work and school addresses from the definition of actual address, such that an actual address only covers a residential address;\nAllowing a program participant to apply with their actual address and either a telephone number or an email address, rather than requiring a telephone number;\nClarifying that entities and agencies must use a substitute address in the place of the name of a school or employer or for a program participant's home-based business, if requested;\nIncreasing the court fine applied to convictions for certain offenses, which is used to fund the program, from $28 to $33 and expanding this fine by applying it to convictions for sexual assault and municipal offenses for domestic violence, stalking, sexual assault, and human trafficking;\nCreating a process to allow program participants to shield real property records from public inspection; and\nAllowing a criminal justice official or government agency that has requested and been approved for expedited disclosure of a program participant's actual address to share the actual address with a law enforcement agency for the purpose of conducting a welfare check.\n\n\nThe bill also makes technical and conforming amendments.\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "House Committee on Finance Postpone Indefinitely", "date": "2025-03-10T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "House Committee on Judiciary Refer Amended to Finance", "date": "2025-02-12T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Judiciary", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Judiciary", "date": "2025-01-08T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Judiciary", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Jacque Phillips", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Jacque Phillips\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Yara Zokaie", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Yara Zokaie\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "Introduced (01/08/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_1028_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "PA1 (02/13/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_1028_h_jud_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Committee Amendment", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2025a_hb1028_h_fin_001.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [{"note": "Fiscal Note FN2 (05/15/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_hb1028_f1.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Fiscal Note FN1 (01/21/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_hb1028_00.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb25-1028", "note": ""}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:co/government", "name": "Colorado", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:co"}, "scraped_at": "2025-05-21T00:10:37+00:00", "_id": "05419e0c-35d8-11f0-8e0b-32d15865c953"}
