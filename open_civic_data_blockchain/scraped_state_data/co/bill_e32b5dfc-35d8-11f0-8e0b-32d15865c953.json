Current law also requires a vacancy committee to consist of, at a minimum, the members of the central committee of a jurisdiction. The bill requires that a vacancy committee selected by a central committee to fill a vacancy also consist of, at a minimum, the individuals elected as delegates to the applicable jurisdiction's district assembly. The bill modifies the vacancy committee statutes for the office of county commissioner and members of the state school board in accordance with this change.\nCurrently, if the vacancy committee for a vacancy in the office of county commissioner fails to fill the vacancy within 10 days, the governor is required to fill the vacancy by appointment within 15 days after the vacancy occurs. The bill extends these timing requirements to 30 days and 35 days respectively.\n\nCurrently, a vacancy committee to fill a vacancy in the general assembly may not meet to select a person to fill a vacancy unless a written notice of the time and location of the meeting was mailed to each of the committee members at least 10 days prior to the meeting. The bill modifies the notice requirement by requiring the notice to be mailed at least 6 days prior to the meeting.\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "House Committee on State, Civic, Military, & Veterans Affairs Postpone Indefinitely", "date": "2025-04-07T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to State, Civic, Military, & Veterans Affairs", "date": "2025-01-27T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "State, Civic, Military, & Veterans Affairs", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Stephanie Luck", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Stephanie Luck\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "Introduced (01/27/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_1100_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Committee Amendment", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2025a_hb1100_h_sa_001.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [{"note": "Fiscal Note FN1 (02/05/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_hb1100_00.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb25-1100", "note": ""}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:co/government", "name": "Colorado", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:co"}, "scraped_at": "2025-05-21T00:16:48+00:00", "_id": "e32b5dfc-35d8-11f0-8e0b-32d15865c953"}
