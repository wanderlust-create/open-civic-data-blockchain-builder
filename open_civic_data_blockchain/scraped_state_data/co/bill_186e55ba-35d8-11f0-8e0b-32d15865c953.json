The bill raises the fees for the following by $4 and allows the county clerks to retain the additional $4:\n\n\nIssuing:\n\n\n\nMotor vehicle and other vehicle registrations requiring license plates;\nTemporary registration license plates;\nA validation tab, sticker, decal, or certificate for license plates; and\nA certificate of title;\n\n\n\nFiling, extending, or releasing a lien; and\nObtaining a copy of a recorded title.\n\n\nThe department must increase these fees to account for inflation, but the department may not increase a fee more than 5% per year.\n\nCurrent law authorizes a county clerk to set fees for shipping and handling of license plates. The bill authorizes the county clerk to set fees for the shipping and handling of motor vehicle documents. The county clerk is required to set and publish the fee by October 15 for registration periods beginning January 1 of the following year.\n\nCurrent law allows people to register vehicles for less than one year so that each of their vehicles expire on the same month. The bill removes the multiple-vehicle requirement to allow people to register a vehicle for less than one year for any reason. The request may be made only one time in the twelve months after the transaction date\nCurrent law requires a salvage vehicle's title to have a brand that says \"rebuilt from salvage\". The bill requires this brand to include a disclosure statement, which must:\n\n\nInclude the reason the vehicle is salvage, as listed in statute;\nContain a statement from the owner stating the nature of the damage that resulted in the determination that the vehicle is a salvage vehicle; and\nContain the signature of the seller and buyer to sell the salvage vehicle.\n\n\nCurrent law requires the seller of a salvage vehicle to provide a disclosure statement of the fact and have it signed. And if the buyer does not know about the vehicle being rebuilt from salvage, the buyer is entitled to a refund. The bill requires this disclosure statement and the buyer to be provided the refund only if the title of a salvage vehicle does not have the brand on the title or the vehicle is subject to multiple assignments.\n\nCurrent law provides the option to have a rebuilder's certificate of title when a motor vehicle is a collector's item, the applicant is unable to provide appropriate evidence of ownership, and the applicant posts a bond. The bill authorizes the department to issue a rebuilder's certificate of title to people who can prove ownership. Under the current process, 2 bonds may be required. The bill changes the process to require only one bond.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Third Reading Passed -
