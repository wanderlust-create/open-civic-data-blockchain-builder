The exemption allows for a covenant not to compete under specified conditions governing an individual who earns an amount of annualized cash compensation equivalent to or greater than the threshold amount for highly compensated workers. The bill excludes from the highly compensated worker exemption a covenant not to compete that restricts the practice of medicine, the practice of advanced practice registered nursing, or the practice of dentistry in this state.\n\nUnder current law, there is also an exemption from the general prohibition against covenants not to solicit customers (nonsolicitation covenant) that allows for a nonsolicitation covenant governing an individual who earns an amount of annualized cash compensation equivalent to or greater than 60% of the threshold amount for highly compensated workers if the nonsolicitation covenant is no broader than reasonably necessary to protect the employer's legitimate interest in protecting trade secrets. The bill also excludes from the highly compensated worker exemption for nonsolicitation covenants a covenant not to compete that restricts the practice of medicine, the practice of advanced practice registered nursing, or the practice of dentistry.\n\nA covenant not to compete governing an individual who has a minority ownership share of a business and who received their ownership share in the business as equity compensation or otherwise in connection with services rendered is permissible if the covenant's duration in years does not exceed a number calculated by the total consideration received by the individual from the sale divided by the average annualized cash compensation received by the individual from the business, including income received on account of the individual's ownership interest during the preceding 2 years or during the period of time that the individual was affiliated with the business, whichever period of time is shorter.\n Provisions in a covenant not to compete that allow an employer to recover the following expenses are permitted by the bill, if the employer's recovery of the expense decreases proportionally over the course of not more than 3 years subsequent to the beginning of an individual's employment:\n\n\nRelocation expenses paid by the employer on behalf of an individual;\nA signing bonus or other remuneration paid by the employer to an individual to induce the individual to relocate or, in the case of a health-care provider, to establish a health-care practice in a specified geographic area;\nRecruiting expenses paid by the employer to recruit a health-care provider; or\nMarketing expenses paid by the employer to market an individual health-care provider.\n\n\nThe bill prohibits a covenant that prevents or materially restricts a health-care provider from disclosing to a patient to whom the health-care provider was providing consultation or treatment before the health-care provider's departure from a medical practice the following information:\n\n\nThe health-care provider's continuing practice of medicine;\nThe health-care provider's new professional contact information; or\nThe patient's right to choose a medical provider.\n\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-08T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-08T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-08T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Considered House Amendments - Result was to Concur - Repass", "date": "2025-04-21T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-14T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Special Order - Passed with Amendments - Committee, Floor", "date": "2025-04-11T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Laid Over Daily - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-08T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Committee on Business Affairs & Labor Refer Amended to House Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-04-03T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "House Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Business Affairs & Labor", "date": "2025-03-12T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Business Affairs & Labor", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-03-12T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Passed with Amendments - Committee", "date": "2025-03-11T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["reading-2"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Business, Labor, & Technology Refer Amended to Senate Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-03-06T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Senate Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Business, Labor, & Technology", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Business, Labor, & Technology", "date": "2025-01-23T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Business, Labor, & Technology", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Lindsey Daugherty", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Lindsey Daugherty\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Lisa Frizell", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Lisa Frizell\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Kyle Brown", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Kyle Brown\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Lori Garcia Sander", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Lori Garcia Sander\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "J.
