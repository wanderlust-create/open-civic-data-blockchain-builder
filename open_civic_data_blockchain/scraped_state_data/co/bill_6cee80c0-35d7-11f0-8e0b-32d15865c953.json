The bill changes how income tax expenditures that benefit individuals engaged in military service are provided as follows:\n\n\nBeginning with income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2027, section 2 of the bill eliminates the state income tax subtraction for an amount equal to any compensation received for active duty service in the armed forces of the United States by an individual who has reacquired residency in the state to the extent that the compensation is included in federal taxable income; and\nFor income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2027, but before January 1, 2032, section 3 allows a refundable income tax credit (credit) as a form of tuition assistance to an actively serving member of the Colorado National Guard who is eligible for tuition assistance (eligible member) under an existing statutorily-authorized program (program) administered by the department of veterans and military affairs (department).\n\n\nTo claim the credit, an eligible member must obtain a tax credit certificate issued by the department for each academic semester or quarter for which tuition assistance is awarded in the form of the credit.\n\nThe criteria for receiving a tax credit certificate are generally the same as the criteria for receiving other tuition assistance under the program; except that, to be eligible for a tax credit certificate, an eligible member must apply for all federal government tuition assistance that is not required to be repaid and that is generally made available to eligible members and not to the general population and must use all federal government tuition assistance received. The total amount of tuition assistance that an eligible member to whom the department has issued a tax credit certificate may obtain under the program, including the credit, is subject to existing program limits. In addition, the department may issue no more than $1 million in tax credit certificates for any income tax year.\n Section 1 makes conforming amendments.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "House Committee on Appropriations Lay Over Unamended - Amendment(s) Failed", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "House Committee on Finance Refer Amended to Appropriations", "date": "2025-01-27T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Finance + Appropriations", "date": "2025-01-08T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Bob Marshall", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Bob Marshall\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Junie Joseph", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Junie Joseph\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Larry Liston", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Larry Liston\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "L.
