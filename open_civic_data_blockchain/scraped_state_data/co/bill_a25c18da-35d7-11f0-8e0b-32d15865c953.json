The bill instead requires that the demand letter must be written in English or, if requested by the tenant at the time the tenant enters into the lease, in another language that is the tenant's primary language.\n\nUnder current law, a landlord is permitted to post a notice to vacate in a conspicuous place on the premises after at least one unsuccessful attempt at service on 2 separate days. The bill allows the landlord to post the notice in a conspicuous place on the premises after only one unsuccessful attempt to serve the tenant with the notice.\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "House Committee on Transportation, Housing & Local Government Postpone Indefinitely", "date": "2025-02-26T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "Transportation", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Local Government", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Transportation, Housing & Local Government", "date": "2025-02-10T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Transportation, Housing & Local Government", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Transportation", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Local Government", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Dan Woog", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Dan Woog\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Jacque Phillips", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Jacque Phillips\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "C.
