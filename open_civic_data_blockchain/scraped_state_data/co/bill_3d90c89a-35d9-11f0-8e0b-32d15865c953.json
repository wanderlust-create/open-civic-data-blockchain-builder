The bill requires gas or electric investor-owned utilities that serve more than 500,000 customers to propose a plan to the public utilities commission for establishing or expanding an existing on-bill repayment program for the commission to review and approve, disapprove, or modify.\nThe bill requires the state treasurer , on July 1, 2025, to make an 3 interest-free loan in the amount of $100 loans totaling $50 million from the unclaimed property trust fund to the state utility on-bill repayment program cash fund, which fund is created in the bill, to support the financing of the on-bill repayment programs. The office is required to pay back the loan by July 1, 2045 January 1, 2046 . As an alternative financing mechanism for the on-bill programs, the bill authorizes the department of the treasury to offer on-bill financing tax credits (tax credits) to insurance companies authorized to do business in Colorado, which insurance companies have premium tax liability owing to the state (qualified taxpayers). The tax credits will only be offered if the relevant quarterly state revenue forecast shows that the state's nonexempt revenue will be at least $50 million under the limit on state fiscal year spending authorized under section 20 of article X of the state constitution, as modified by Referendum C. The bill creates a building decarbonization enterprise (enterprise) to:\n\n\nProvide financing assistance, technical assistance, and other programmatic assistance to covered building owners to effectively and efficiently implement building decarbonization measures, including energy efficiency measures, electrification measures, and energy upgrades; and\nProvide technical assistance and other programmatic support to utilities that accept financing from the office for the purpose of establishing or expanding an on-bill program.\n\nThe enterprise is authorized to impose and collect from covered building owners an annual building decarbonization fee and impose and collect from participating utilities an annual on-bill program administration fee to cover the enterprise's costs in providing financial, technical, and programmatic assistance to covered building owners and participating utilities.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary;
