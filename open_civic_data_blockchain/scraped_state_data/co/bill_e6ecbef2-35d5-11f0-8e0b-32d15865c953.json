The platform would automatically review an application for a residential solar panel installation and issue a permit for the residential solar panel installation project if the project is code-compliant and meets certain criteria.\nThe platform utilized by a county or municipality must be used for at least 75% of the residential solar panel installation permit applications submitted to the local jurisdiction. The platform will only be used for solar panel installations that will be installed on existing residential buildings, have a maximum capacity of 200 amperes main service disconnect, and provide electrical power to single-family or 2-family residential property.\n\nA county or municipality required to implement the platform must notify the Colorado energy office (office) of its compliance with the requirements of the bill and submit an annual report to the office related to the use of the platform and the type of software used.\n\nCounties and municipalities are also eligible to receive funding and technical assistance from the office to implement platforms.\n\nThe office is required to submit a report to the general assembly related to the use of automated permitting software for other residential electrification projects, such as electric vehicle charging stations and heat pump space heaters, and the costs and benefits of implementing the automated software. The office must submit the report by July 1, 2026.\n\nThe state electrical board in the department of regulatory agencies is also required to implement a platform for use in its issuance and review of electrical permits related to residential solar panel installations. The board must also notify the office of its compliance with adopting the platform and submit an annual report to the office related to the board's use of the platform.\n The bill makes updates to the streamlined solar permitting and inspection grant program (grant program). The grant program provides funding for the adoption and implementation of automated permitting and inspection software. The bill clarifies that funding from the grant program may be used by a recipient for eligible expenses for up to 3 years after the grantee implements the automated permitting and inspection software. The bill also permits the Colorado energy office (office) to spend up to 9% of the money remaining in the grant program's cash fund as of September 1, 2025, for paying the direct and indirect costs of the office in administering the grant program.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Third Reading Passed -
