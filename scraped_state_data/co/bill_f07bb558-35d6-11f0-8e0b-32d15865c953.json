Beginning January 1, 2025, this subtraction is also allowed to any individual who is 55 years of age or older and has an adjusted gross income for the applicable tax year that is less than or equal to $75,000 if filing individually or $95,000 if filing jointly.\n\nFor income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2026, the bill removes all caps on the deduction for amounts received as pensions and annuities and allows any individual, regardless of age or income, to subtract the total amount that the individual received as pension or annuity income from the individual's federal taxable income, to the extent that income was included in federal taxable income, when determining the individual's state taxable income.\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Senate Committee on State, Veterans, & Military Affairs Postpone Indefinitely", "date": "2025-02-27T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "State, Veterans, & Military Affairs", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to State, Veterans, & Military Affairs", "date": "2025-02-05T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "State, Veterans, & Military Affairs", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Byron Pelton", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Byron Pelton\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Ryan Gonzalez", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Ryan Gonzalez\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "Introduced (02/05/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_136_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Committee Amendment", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2025a_sb136_s_sa_001.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [{"note": "Fiscal Note FN1 (02/20/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_sb136_00.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25-136", "note": ""}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:co/government", "name": "Colorado", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:co"}, "scraped_at": "2025-05-21T00:02:52+00:00", "_id": "f07bb558-35d6-11f0-8e0b-32d15865c953"}
