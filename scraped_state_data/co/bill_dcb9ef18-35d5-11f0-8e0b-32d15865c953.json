The bill replaces these provisions by creating a presumption that certain low- or very low-risk inmates who have reached their parole eligibility dates will be granted parole. The bill also requires the state board to provide a monthly report to the department on the status of hearings for these low- and very low-risk inmates.\n\nIf an offender is otherwise eligible for parole or placement in a community corrections program but has an outstanding warrant or detainer, the parole board or the executive director shall notify the public defender liaison, who shall determine if the warrant or detainer may be resolved and notify the executive director of the outcome.\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "House Second Reading Laid Over Daily -
