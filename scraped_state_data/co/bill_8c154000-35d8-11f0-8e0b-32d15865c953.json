{"legislative_session": "2025A", "identifier": "HB25-1073", "title": "Protections Against Child Rape", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": [], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Under current law, sexual assault on a child is a class 4 felony if the victim is under 15 years of age, the actor is at least 4 years older than the victim, and specified aggravating circumstances do not apply. Sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust is a class 4 felony if the actor is in a position of trust with respect to the victim, the victim is 15 years of age or older but under 18 years of age, and the offense is not committed as part of a pattern of sexual abuse. If the offense is committed as part of a pattern of sexual abuse or the victim is less than 15 years of age, sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust is a class 3 felony.\nThe presumptive range of penalties for a class 4 felony under current law is 2 to 6 years of imprisonment. The presumptive range of penalties for a class 3 felony under current law is 4 to 12 years of imprisonment. Under current law, a court shall sentence a sex offender to an indeterminate term in the custody of the department of corrections that can range from the applicable presumptive range minimum to a maximum of the sex offender's natural life. However, current law permits the court to sentence a sex offender to probation for an indeterminate period that can range from 10 years for a class 4 felony and 20 years for a class 3 felony to a maximum of the sex offender's natural life.\n\nThe bill requires a court to sentence an offender convicted of a class 4 felony sexual assault on a child or sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust to an indeterminate term of incarceration that can range from the presumptive range minimum of 2 years to a maximum of the offender's natural life. The bill requires a court to sentence an offender convicted of a class 3 felony sexual assault on a child by one in a position of trust when the child is less than 15 years of age to an indeterminate term of incarceration that can range from the presumptive range minimum of 4 years to a maximum of the offender's natural life. The bill prohibits a court from sentencing these types of offenders to probation.\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "House Committee on Judiciary Postpone Indefinitely", "date": "2025-03-12T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "Judiciary", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Judiciary", "date": "2025-01-08T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Judiciary", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Brandi Bradley", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Brandi Bradley\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Regina English", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Regina English\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Janice Rich", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Janice Rich\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Marc Snyder", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Marc Snyder\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "Introduced (01/08/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_1073_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Committee Amendment", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2025a_hb1073_h_jud_001.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [{"note": "Fiscal Note FN1 (02/05/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_hb1073_00.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb25-1073", "note": ""}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:co/government", "name": "Colorado", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:co"}, "scraped_at": "2025-05-21T00:14:23+00:00", "_id": "8c154000-35d8-11f0-8e0b-32d15865c953"}
