Section 2  authorizes the division to use money in the local firefighter safety and disease prevention fund to:\n\nProvide need-based grants to fire service governing bodies and volunteer fire departments for the cost of certain firefighter certification courses, course materials, textbooks, instructors, and written testing and to provide fire instructor I or equivalent certification for instructors who want to participate in a train-the-trainer program created by the division;\nSubject to appropriations by the general assembly, create a train-the-trainer program to ensure that all instructors providing grant-funded certification classes described in the bill teach a consistent curriculum; and\nSubject to appropriations by the general assembly, create a statewide outreach program to promote fire service careers, including marketing materials targeted to youth, an online portal to access career pathways and resources, and marketing materials that include social media.\n\n The bill requires the state treasurer to make an interest-free loan of $50 million from the unclaimed property trust fund (UPTF loan) to the department of local affairs (department). The department shall use the UPTF loan to create a zero-interest revolving loan program (loan program) to benefit fire departments. Eligible fire departments include town, city, county, and city and county fire protection organizations, fire protection districts, or other districts that provide fire protection, as well as volunteer fire departments. \nEligible uses of loans made to fire departments under the loan program may include:\n\n\nThe purchase of rolling stock, such as fire trucks, brush trucks, and fast attack vehicles, and associated apparatus;\nCapital improvements for existing or new facilities;\nThe purchase of other facilities, infrastructure, or equipment for the state's firefighter workforce to respond to emergencies and ensure public safety; and\nTemporary bridge loans to cover unusual costs in response to emergencies.\n\n\nPrior to making loans to fire departments, the department shall consult with statewide associations representing fire chiefs and firefighters and the division of fire prevention and control in the department of public safety.\n\nThe department may charge an administrative fee of up to one-half of one percent on the principal amount of the loans made to fire departments and may use earnings from the investment of the UPTF loan to administer the loan program. \n\nThe bill creates a fund in the state treasury for use by the department for the UPTF loan and requires the department to pay the UPTF loan back to the UPTF not later than July 1, 2065.\n\nIn addition, the bill creates the firefighter first homeownership program (homeownership program) and, if implemented, authorizes the state treasurer to invest money from the UPTF in the homeownership program. If implemented, the Colorado housing and finance authority or another entity selected by the state treasurer will serve as the program manager. The state treasurer shall purchase from the program manager mortgage products in tranches of reasonable amounts. The program manager shall establish guidelines and underwriting criteria that:\n\n\nPrioritize first-time homebuyers who use the home as a primary residence;\nProvide shared equity down payment assistance to firefighters; \nAllow appreciation-sharing benefits between the homeownership program and homeowner;\nIf the program manager is the Colorado housing and finance authority, pair a borrower with a mortgage loan provided through the program manager's network of lenders that bears an interest rate at or below market rate; and\nServe homebuyers across diverse geographic areas and housing markets.\n\n\nThe program manager is entitled to normal and customary fees for managing the homeownership program and other costs related to the homeownership program, and shall annually report to the state treasurer concerning the homeownership program.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Senate Committee on Appropriations Postpone Indefinitely", "date": "2025-05-06T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Refer Amended to Appropriations", "date": "2025-05-01T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Agriculture & Natural Resources", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Agriculture & Natural Resources", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "House Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-28T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Special Order - Passed with Amendments - Committee", "date": "2025-04-25T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Committee on Appropriations Refer Amended to House Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-04-25T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "House Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "House Committee on Agriculture, Water & Natural Resources Refer Amended to Appropriations", "date": "2025-02-10T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Agriculture, Water & Natural Resources", "date": "2025-01-10T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Agriculture, Water & Natural Resources", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Andrew Boesenecker", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Andrew Boesenecker\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Elizabeth Velasco", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Elizabeth Velasco\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Janice Marchman", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Janice Marchman\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Lisa Cutter", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Lisa Cutter\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "T.
