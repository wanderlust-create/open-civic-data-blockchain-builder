{"legislative_session": "2025A", "identifier": "HB25-1283", "title": "Wild Horse Project Management & Immunocontraception", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": [], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "The wild horse working group is given the duty in statute to study wild horse management in Colorado and make recommendations. The group has made a report with its preliminary recommendations. The bill adds many of these recommendations in the wild horse statutes.\n\nUnder current law, the wild horse project is a nonprofit, state-owned corporate entity that manages and operates programs benefitting wild horses and supports wild horse management. The bill repeals the wild horse project and transfers the statutory duties concerning wild horses to the department of agriculture (department). The bill repeals and replaces the wild horse stewardship program and the wild horse fertility program with support efforts managed by the department and with an immunocontraception program managed by the department.\n\nThe bill authorizes the department to provide immunocontraception and material support in herd management areas to keep wild horse populations at appropriate management levels. The material support may include:\n\n\nUsing state employees or contracting with others to administer immunocontraception;\nProviding funding to or administrative support to other state agencies, federal agencies, and nonprofit entities to hire employees or contract with agents to administer immunocontraception;\nCoordinating events where immunocontraception is administered;\nBuying or funding the purchase of equipment or technology; and\nCoordinating with educational institutions to provide training, certification, or internships to individuals administering immunocontraception.\n\n\nThe department may primarily address federally protected wild horses but may also address other wild horses.\n\nThe department may, when reasonable and effective:\n\n\nExpand efforts to engage nonprofit organizations and foundations that are not normally associated with wild horse advocacy organizations;\nEngage individuals and businesses for funding, promotion, and education using iconic wild horse imagery; and\nDevelop a logo and brand.\n\n\nThe department may provide staff, resources, or information to:\n\n\nDevelop a system of shared equipment and staff expertise to loan out;\nDevelop training programs and certifications;\nCooperate with the federal bureau of land management to develop additional training, holding, or adoption opportunities; and\nCooperate with the department of corrections to create and expand opportunities for people confined in a correctional facility.\n\n\nThe bill creates a wild horse advisory committee. The wild horse advisory committee has the same makeup as the current wild horse working group, with the following changes:\n\nThe legislative appointments are changed to at-large appointment; and\nThe mandatory appointments are made by the commissioner of agriculture; and\n The following appointments must be made in consultation with specified legislative leadership: Two at-large appointments, two representatives of nonprofit advocacy organizations, a resident of the western slope, a representative of a nonprofit environmental conservation organization, two representatives of the ranching and grazing permit holder community, and a representative from each of the local on-range wild horse organizations that maintain memoranda of understanding with the federal bureau of land management.\n\n\nThe advisory committee will meet at least once every year and may have additional meetings as necessary. The advisory committee shall advise the commissioner of agriculture and the department concerning:\n\n\nFinancial and material support for wild horse adopters, sanctuaries, preserves, and refuges;\nThe content and delivery of outreach, education, training, and certification;\nWorking with the federal bureau of land management and wild horse preserves, sanctuaries, and refuges to coordinate the movement of wild horses off herd management areas and other lands into temporary holding, adoption events, and other options;\nCoordinating or assisting with compliance checks to ensure that adopted wild horses are well cared for and that wild horse adopters have the support needed to successfully care for wild horses;\nCoordinating and cooperating with other entities to ensure comprehensive information about adoption and adoption success is widely publicized and is available to the public; and\nAny different or additional scientifically proven immunocontraceptive fertility control method the department may consider using.\n\n\nThe wild horse advisory committee sunsets on September 1, 2030, which is in 5 years. Before the repeal, the advisory committee is scheduled for sunset review.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-12T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-12T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-12T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Considered Senate Amendments -
