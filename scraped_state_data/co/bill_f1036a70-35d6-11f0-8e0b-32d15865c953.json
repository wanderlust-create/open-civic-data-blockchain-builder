If at the 2026 general election the voters of the state approve a referred constitutional amendment to allow a senior or a surviving spouse who has previously qualified for the exemption for 2016 or any later year for a prior residence to claim the exemption for the senior's or surviving spouse's current residence regardless of how long the senior or surviving spouse has owned and occupied that residence, the bill makes the statutory changes needed to conform to the constitutional amendment.\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "House Committee on Finance Postpone Indefinitely", "date": "2025-02-24T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Finance", "date": "2025-01-27T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Ken DeGraaf", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Ken DeGraaf\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "Introduced (01/27/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_1111_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Committee Amendment", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2025a_hb1111_h_fin_001.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [{"note": "Fiscal Note FN2 (03/19/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_hb1111_f1.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Fiscal Note FN1 (02/06/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_hb1111_00.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb25-1111", "note": ""}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:co/government", "name": "Colorado", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:co"}, "scraped_at": "2025-05-21T00:02:53+00:00", "_id": "f1036a70-35d6-11f0-8e0b-32d15865c953"}
