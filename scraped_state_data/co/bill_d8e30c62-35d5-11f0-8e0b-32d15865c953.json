The state received money from the federal coronavirus state fiscal recovery fund pursuant to the \"American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\" (ARPA money). ARPA money was deposited into the \"American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\" cash fund, transferred to various other cash funds (recipient funds), and appropriated from recipient funds for various programs. House Bill 24-1466, enacted in 2024, refinanced appropriated ARPA money with state money (state refinance money).\nThe bill transfers ARPA money to recipient funds to cover the costs of projects funded with ARPA money and transfers unspent state refinance money from recipient funds to the general fund. The bill adjusts existing appropriations to reflect spent ARPA money and unspent state refinance money and amends program statutes to align with the appropriations adjustments.\n\nARPA money must be obligated by December 31, 2024, and spent by December 31, 2026. Under federal law, as explained in guidance from the United States department of the treasury, the state may reclassify obligated but unspent ARPA money after December 31, 2024, upon the occurrence of certain events (qualifying events). The bill reverts money upon a qualifying event from the recipient fund to the \"American Rescue Plan Act of 2021\" cash fund and appropriates that money to the governor for an alternate eligible use for which a general fund appropriation was made. Under existing law, the general fund appropriation is reduced by the amount of ARPA money spent for the line item of appropriation.\n\nThe bill repeals the requirement for the department of public health and environment to engage in recruitment and re-engagement of workers in the health-care profession because the bill ends the appropriation of money for that purpose.\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-05-02T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Special Order - Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-05-01T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Committee on Appropriations Refer Unamended to House Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-05-01T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "House Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Appropriations", "date": "2025-04-30T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-30T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Special Order - Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Appropriations Refer Unamended - Consent Calendar to Senate Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Appropriations", "date": "2025-04-24T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Judy Amabile", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Judy Amabile\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Barbara Kirkmeyer", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Barbara Kirkmeyer\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Shannon Bird", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Shannon Bird\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Emily Sirota", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Emily Sirota\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "J.
