Among other things related to affordable housing, Proposition 123, which was approved by the voters at the 2022 statewide election, created the affordable housing support fund (fund) and continuously appropriated money from the fund to the division of housing within the department of local affairs (department) for enumerated uses relating to an affordable home ownership program and a program serving persons experiencing homelessness and to the division of local government, also within the department, for enumerated uses relating to a local planning capacity development program. A specified percentage of money from the fund is allocated for the implementation of each program, and from each allocated percentage the division of housing or the division of local government, as applicable, is permitted to use up to 5% to pay for the direct and indirect costs of administering each program.\nBeginning in state fiscal year 2026-27, the bill makes the expenditure of up to 5% of the money from each program's allocation of funding for administration of each program subject to annual appropriation by the general assembly and clarifies how that 5% amount is calculated.\n\nThe bill also allows the division of housing, subject to annual appropriation by the general assembly, to expend money under the program serving persons experiencing homelessness for:\n\n\nCapital needs at 2 state-owned supportive residential communities for persons experiencing homelessness (supportive residential communities); and\nDirect and indirect costs of operating the 2 supportive residential communities.\n\n\nProposition 123 also included a prohibition on the general assembly appropriating funds from the fund and the affordable housing financing fund to supplant other state support for affordable housing projects. The bill clarifies when appropriations from the fund and the affordable housing financing fund would violate this prohibition.\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-05-02T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Special Order - Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-05-01T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Committee on Appropriations Refer Unamended to House Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-05-01T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "House Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Appropriations", "date": "2025-04-30T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-30T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Special Order - Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Appropriations Refer Unamended to Senate Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Senate Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Appropriations", "date": "2025-04-24T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Judy Amabile", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Judy Amabile\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Jeff Bridges", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Jeff Bridges\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Shannon Bird", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Shannon Bird\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Emily Sirota", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Emily Sirota\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "B.
