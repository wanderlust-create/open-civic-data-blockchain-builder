{"legislative_session": "2025A", "identifier": "SB25-163", "title": "Battery Stewardship Programs", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": [], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "The bill requires an organization, defined in the bill as a battery stewardship organization, to, no later than July 1, 2026, 2027, and every 5 years thereafter, submit to the executive director of the department of public health and environment (executive director) a battery stewardship plan (plan), which is a plan for the collection, transportation, processing, and recycling of certain batteries.\nOn and after August 1, 2026, 2027, a producer selling, making available for sale, or distributing certain batteries or battery-containing products in or into the state must participate in and finance a battery stewardship organization that has submitted a plan to the executive director. On and after July 1, 2028, 2029, a retailer is prohibited from selling, offering for sale, distributing, or otherwise making available for sale certain batteries or battery-containing products in the state, unless the producer of the batteries or battery-containing products is participating in a battery stewardship organization that has an approved plan. A retailer is prohibited from charging a point-of-sale fee to consumers to cover the costs of a battery stewardship organization.\nThe bill specifies what a plan must contain to be approved by the executive director, including, among other things, contact information for participating producers, performance goals, and methods to promote participation in the plan and increase public awareness of the battery stewardship program (program) that will be implemented by the battery stewardship organization pursuant to the plan. In addition, a plan must detail how the battery stewardship organization will arrange for the collection of certain batteries by establishing collection sites that are freely available to any person.\n\nA battery stewardship organization implementing an approved plan is required to develop and administer a system to collect charges from participating producers to cover the costs of implementing the program. In addition, a battery stewardship organization, in consultation with the department of public health and environment (department) and interested stakeholders, must complete an assessment of the opportunities and challenges associated with the end-of-life management of certain batteries, which assessment must be submitted to the general assembly on or before October 1, 2027. March 1, 2028.\nOn or before June 1, 2028, 2029, and on or before each June 1 thereafter, a battery stewardship organization with an approved plan must submit an annual report to the executive director, which report must include certain information about the preceding year of plan implementation. The bill also requires a battery stewardship organization to carry out promotional activities to increase public awareness of the program. Battery stewardship organizations with approved plans must coordinate to conduct a survey of public awareness of the programs and share the results of the survey with the executive director as part of the annual reports. On or before December 1, 2026, and on or before each December 1 thereafter, the department must provide each battery stewardship organization with an accounting of the organization's portion of the costs in administering a program, and the battery stewardship organization is required to pay to the department an annual fee based on the department's accounting by July 1 of each year. Fees will be credited to the battery stewardship fund created in the state treasury. A battery stewardship organization is required to pay a one-time fee of $50,000 at the time of submittal of a plan to the executive director. If the executive director approves the plan, the battery stewardship organization is required to pay an additional fee of $30,000. Within 12 months after a plan is approved, and on or before each July 1 thereafter, a battery stewardship organization must pay to the department an annual fee to cover the department's cost of implementing, administering, and enforcing the bill's requirements. The amount of the first annual fee is $80,000, and the amount for each annual fee thereafter is to be established by the solid and hazardous waste commission. \nThe bill requires a producer or retailer to mark certain batteries with labels that:\n\n\nIdentify the producer of the batteries; and\nInclude certain information to ensure the proper collection and recycling of the batteries.\n\n\nBeginning January 1, 2029, 2030, a person is required to manage certain unwanted batteries through delivery to a collection site, program, or event established by the program. A person is prohibited from disposing of certain batteries in a landfill. A producer or battery stewardship organization that violates any of the bill's requirements is liable for a civil penalty of $7,000 per violation; except that a battery stewardship organization that fails to pay a fee required by the department pursuant to the bill's requirements is liable for a civil penalty that is double the applicable fee. The department will enforce violations of the bill's requirements pursuant to the enforcement process for the state hazardous waste management program.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Considered House Amendments -
