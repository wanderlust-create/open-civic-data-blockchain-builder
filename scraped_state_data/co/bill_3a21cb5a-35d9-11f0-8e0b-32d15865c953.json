Section 1  of the bill requires an electric or gas public utility (utility) to protect the personal data of its customers. The utility is prohibited from disclosing, selling, or reselling a customer's personal data to:\n\n\nA state or federal government entity, unless the disclosure is necessary for participation in a state or federal assistance program; or\nA third party.\n\n Under current law, utilities regulated by the public utilities commission (commission) are prohibited from disconnecting a customer's utility service for nonpayment under certain circumstances.  Sections 2 through 4  add the following circumstances in which disconnection of utility service for nonpayment is prohibited:\n\nDuring periods of extreme heat or cold, including during the months of October through May;\nIf the air quality index measures over 100; and\nDuring a period in which a residential customer has a medical emergency, as evidenced by a medical certificate from a licensed physician or health-care provider, and requiring the utility to postpone the disconnection of service for up to 180 days.\n\nThe bill also applies the prohibitions regarding disconnection of a utility customer's service due to nonpayment to electric and gas municipal utilities and cooperative electric associations that have not exempted themselves from regulation by the commission.\n Section 5  requires a utility to use money collected from the energy assistance system benefit charge for direct bill payment assistance year-round, including for customers participating in the low-income energy assistance program when assistance through that program is unavailable. The bill prohibits the department of human services (department) from requiring an applicant for the low-income home energy assistance program (program) to provide their citizenship or immigration status on an application for assistance under the program, unless that information is required as a condition of eligibility for the program. The department is also prohibited from sharing information related to the citizenship or immigration status of an applicant for or recipient of assistance under the program with any federal law enforcement agency, unless disclosure is required by law or court order. If an individual applies for assistance under the program and the individual's application is denied due to insufficient or incomplete documentation, the department must provide notice to the applicant that their application has been denied and provide the applicant at least 60 days to correct or complete the application. During that 60-day period, the public utility of which the applicant is a customer is prohibited from disconnecting the applicant's utility service for nonpayment while their application is pending review.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-04-30T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Considered Senate Amendments - Result was to Concur - Repass", "date": "2025-04-11T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Considered Senate Amendments - Result was to Laid Over Daily", "date": "2025-04-06T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-04T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Third Reading Laid Over to 04/04/2025 - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-01T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Passed with Amendments - Committee", "date": "2025-03-31T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["reading-2"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Transportation & Energy Refer Amended to Senate Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-03-26T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Senate Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Transportation & Energy", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Transportation & Energy", "date": "2025-03-20T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Transportation & Energy", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "House Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-03-17T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Special Order - Passed with Amendments - Committee, Floor", "date": "2025-03-14T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Laid Over Daily - No Amendments", "date": "2025-03-11T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Committee on Energy & Environment Refer Amended to House Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-03-06T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "House Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Energy & Environment", "date": "2025-02-12T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Energy & Environment", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Naquetta Ricks", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Naquetta Ricks\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Junie Joseph", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Junie Joseph\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Faith Winter", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Faith Winter\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Katie Wallace", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Katie Wallace\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "J.
