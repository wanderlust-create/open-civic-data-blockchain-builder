This election must be set forth and recorded with the office of a county's clerk and recorder during the month of November.\n\nThe bill modifies this election to allow elected county officials in any county to elect to receive any amount of salary lower than the amount set by law or to receive no salary. The election must be made annually and submitted to the county treasurer no later than 30 days before the county's next fiscal year. The bill also extends to district attorneys, in substantially the same manner, the ability to elect to receive a lower salary than the amount set by law or to receive no salary.\nFor purposes of establishing the salaries of county elected officers, each county in the state is delineated into a specified category. The bill changes Mesa county's categorization from category I-D to category I-A, effective January 1, 2029, which will result in an accompanying percentage increase for the county's elected officials.\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "House Second Reading Laid Over to 05/09/2025 - No Amendments", "date": "2025-03-28T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Laid Over Daily - No Amendments", "date": "2025-03-10T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Committee on State, Civic, Military, & Veterans Affairs Refer Amended to House Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-03-06T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "House Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to State, Civic, Military, & Veterans Affairs", "date": "2025-02-11T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "State, Civic, Military, & Veterans Affairs", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Matt Soper", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Matt Soper\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "Introduced (02/11/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_1229_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "PA1 (03/07/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_1229_h_sa_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Committee Amendment", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2025a_hb1229_h_sa_001.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [{"note": "Fiscal Note FN1 (03/04/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_hb1229_00.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb25-1229", "note": ""}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:co/government", "name": "Colorado", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:co"}, "scraped_at": "2025-05-21T00:17:02+00:00", "_id": "eb343e24-35d8-11f0-8e0b-32d15865c953"}
