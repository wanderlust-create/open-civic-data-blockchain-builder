The bill modifies this requirement so that either a correct notice of the state's liability or a demonstration of a good faith effort to provide a correct notice of the state's liability initiates the 45-day period. \nA state agency that awards a grant generally requires the grant recipient to access the grant amount awarded by applying for the reimbursement of costs incurred in completing the activity for which the state agency awarded the grant. The bill directs the controller to adopt fiscal rules requiring a state agency to award a nonprofit organization a retainer when entering into a contract with or awarding a grant to a nonprofit organization. The retainer amount must equal at least 35% of the grant amount or 35% of the amount to be disbursed by the state to the nonprofit organization in the first year of a contract between the state and the nonprofit organization. A nonprofit organization is required to spend the retainer amount within a year of the state awarding the grant to or entering into the contract with the nonprofit organization. A nonprofit organization may only expend a retainer on expenses the nonprofit organization incurs in connection with the relevant grant or contract.\n\nThe bill also requires a nonprofit organization that receives disbursements from the state to provide the following information to the controller and requires the controller to make that information available upon request:\n\n\nThe ethnicity of the nonprofit organization's leadership;\nThe business structure of the nonprofit organization; and\nWhether the nonprofit organization has previously received a disbursement from the state.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "House Committee on Appropriations Lay Over Unamended - Amendment(s) Failed", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "House Committee on Finance Refer Amended to Appropriations", "date": "2025-02-10T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Finance", "date": "2025-01-27T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Lorena Garc\u00eda", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Lorena Garc\\u00eda\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Jennifer Bacon", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Jennifer Bacon\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Mike Weissman", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Mike Weissman\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "Introduced (01/27/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_1101_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "PA1 (02/11/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_1101_h_fin_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Committee Amendment", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2025a_hb1101_h_fin_001.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [{"note": "Fiscal Note FN1 (02/06/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_hb1101_00.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb25-1101", "note": ""}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:co/government", "name": "Colorado", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:co"}, "scraped_at": "2025-05-21T00:17:19+00:00", "_id": "f5936f02-35d8-11f0-8e0b-32d15865c953"}
