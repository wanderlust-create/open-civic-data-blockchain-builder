The bill clarifies that, for purposes of determining whether a new rental agreement includes reasonable terms, a rent increase in the new rental agreement is reasonable if the landlord increases rent in view of fair market rent, as evidenced by the rental amount of comparable properties.\nAlso under current law, a landlord is prohibited from increasing a tenant's rent in a discriminatory, retaliatory, or unconscionable manner. The bill clarifies that a rent increase is not discriminatory, retaliatory, or unconscionable if the landlord provides evidence showing that the rent increase is in line with fair market rent, as evidenced by the rental amount of comparable properties.\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "House Committee on Transportation, Housing & Local Government Postpone Indefinitely", "date": "2025-02-19T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "Transportation", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Local Government", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Transportation, Housing & Local Government", "date": "2025-01-23T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Transportation, Housing & Local Government", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Transportation", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Local Government", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Ty Winter", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Ty Winter\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Byron Pelton", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Byron Pelton\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "Introduced (01/23/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_1092_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Committee Amendment", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2025a_hb1092_h_thl_001.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [{"note": "Fiscal Note FN1 (01/31/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_hb1092_00.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/hb25-1092", "note": ""}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:co/government", "name": "Colorado", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:co"}, "scraped_at": "2025-05-21T00:16:22+00:00", "_id": "d37acfd2-35d8-11f0-8e0b-32d15865c953"}
