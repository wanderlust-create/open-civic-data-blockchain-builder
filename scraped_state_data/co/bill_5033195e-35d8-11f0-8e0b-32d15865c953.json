The extent to which the rate is temporarily reduced depends on the total amount of excess state revenues remaining after homestead exemption reimbursements and qualified-senior primary residence reimbursements are paid.\nThe bill makes the 4.25% tax rate permanent beginning with the income tax year commencing on January 1, 2025, makes any additional temporarily reduced income tax rate permanent for subsequent income tax years, and eliminates the state income tax on individuals, estates, and trusts for income tax years commencing on or after January 1, 2035.\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Senate Committee on State, Veterans, & Military Affairs Postpone Indefinitely", "date": "2025-02-27T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "State, Veterans, & Military Affairs", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to State, Veterans, & Military Affairs", "date": "2025-02-05T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "State, Veterans, & Military Affairs", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "John Carson", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"John Carson\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "Introduced (02/05/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_138_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Committee Amendment", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2025a_sb138_s_sa_001.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [{"note": "Fiscal Note FN1 (02/20/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_sb138_00.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25-138", "note": ""}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:co/government", "name": "Colorado", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:co"}, "scraped_at": "2025-05-21T00:12:42+00:00", "_id": "5033195e-35d8-11f0-8e0b-32d15865c953"}
