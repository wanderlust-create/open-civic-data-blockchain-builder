The state has a property tax deferral program (program) under which the state makes a secured loan to a qualified taxpayer to pay property taxes owed for the taxpayer's homestead. The program was available only to seniors and persons called into active military service until 2021, when the general assembly expanded the program to also allow an otherwise nonqualifying taxpayer whose property tax had increased by at least a specified percentage (new qualified taxpayer) to participate. In 2022, the general assembly shifted much of the responsibility for the administration of the program from the county treasurers to the state treasurer.\nThe bill reverses the 2022 shift of administrative responsibilities for the program and eliminates program eligibility for new qualified taxpayers so that county treasurers will generally have the same responsibilities for administering the program as they did prior to 2022. The bill also specifies that a new qualified taxpayer may only claim deferral of property taxes levied for a property tax year commencing on or after January 1, 2025, if the board of county commissioners of the county in which the taxpayer's homestead is located has, after receiving input from the county treasurer of that county, adopted a resolution requiring the county treasurer to accept applications for such deferral claims.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary; dashes through words indicate deletions from the original summary.)\n(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-08T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-08T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-08T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Consideration of First Conference Committee Report result was to Adopt Committee Report - Repass", "date": "2025-04-23T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Consideration of First Conference Committee Report result was to Adopt Committee Report - Repass", "date": "2025-04-23T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Considered House Amendments - Result was to Not Concur - Request Conference Committee", "date": "2025-04-11T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-10T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Special Order - Passed with Amendments - Floor", "date": "2025-04-09T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Committee on Appropriations Refer Amended to House Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-04-08T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "House Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Appropriations", "date": "2025-04-03T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-03T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Special Order - Passed with Amendments - Floor", "date": "2025-04-02T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Appropriations Refer Unamended to Senate Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-04-01T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Senate Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Appropriations", "date": "2025-03-31T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Judy Amabile", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Judy Amabile\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Barbara Kirkmeyer", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Barbara Kirkmeyer\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Shannon Bird", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Shannon Bird\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Emily Sirota", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Emily Sirota\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "J.
