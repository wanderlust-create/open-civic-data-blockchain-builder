For this purpose, a covered platform must employ commercially available technologies that are independently certified to be highly effective in establishing that an individual is not a child.\n\nA covered platform may not rely solely upon the geographical registration of an internet protocol address to determine a user's location and must apply extensive due diligence based on available technology before concluding that an individual is not located in Colorado.\n\nA covered platform must ensure that each reasonable age verification measure that the covered platform employs includes a means by which a potential user of the covered platform may appeal a determination concerning the potential user's age.\n\nA covered platform that acquires personal data for the purposes of age verification must destroy the personal data as soon as reasonably possible after a potential user's age is checked for age verification.
