{"legislative_session": "2025A", "identifier": "SB25-159", "title": "Use of Veterinary Telehealth", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": [], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "The bill modifies certain laws related to the practice of veterinary telehealth. Under current law, in order to practice veterinary telehealth in Colorado, a licensed veterinarian must establish a veterinarian-client-patient relationship (VCPR) through an in-person, physical examination of the animal (patient) or by a medically appropriate and timely visit to the premises where the animal is kept.\n\nThe bill allows a veterinarian to establish a VCPR through telehealth. An in-person, physical examination of the patient or visit to the premises is not necessary, and the veterinarian may establish the VCPR through an electronic examination using synchronous audio-video based communication technology.\nThe bill clarifies the definition of \"telehealth\" and changes references throughout current law from \"telemedicine\" to \"telehealth\".\n\nUnder current law, a licensed veterinarian is prohibited from prescribing drugs to a patient through telehealth unless the veterinarian has conducted an in-person, physical examination of the patient. The bill removes that requirement and permits a veterinarian to prescribe drugs to a patient through telehealth as long as the veterinarian has established a VCPR and follows certain requirements. However, the bill still requires an in-person, physical examination of the patient in order to prescribe the patient a controlled substance or an antimicrobial for longer than 14 days.\n\nThe bill removes the requirement under current law that a veterinarian who uses telehealth be available in person at a veterinary premises that is accessible to the client and patient for follow-up evaluations. The bill also repeals a provision in current law that prohibits a veterinary specialist to whom a patient has been referred from prescribing medication to the patient unless that veterinary specialist has established a VCPR through an in-person, physical examination of the patient.\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Senate Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Postpone Indefinitely", "date": "2025-03-20T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Agriculture & Natural Resources Lay Over Unamended - Amendment(s) Failed", "date": "2025-03-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Agriculture & Natural Resources", "date": "2025-02-06T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Agriculture & Natural Resources", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Faith Winter", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Faith Winter\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Lisa Cutter", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Lisa Cutter\"}", "organization_id": null}], "related_bills": [], "versions": [{"note": "Introduced (02/06/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/2025a_159_01.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}, {"note": "Committee Amendment", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/2025a_sb159_s_agr_001.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "documents": [{"note": "Fiscal Note FN1 (02/21/2025)", "links": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/sites/default/files/documents/2025A/bills/fn/2025a_sb159_00.pdf", "media_type": "application/pdf"}], "date": "", "classification": ""}], "citations": [], "sources": [{"url": "https://leg.colorado.gov/bills/sb25-159", "note": ""}], "extras": {}, "jurisdiction": {"id": "ocd-jurisdiction/country:us/state:co/government", "name": "Colorado", "classification": "state", "division_id": "ocd-division/country:us/state:co"}, "scraped_at": "2025-05-21T00:19:13+00:00", "_id": "3953136e-35d9-11f0-8e0b-32d15865c953"}
