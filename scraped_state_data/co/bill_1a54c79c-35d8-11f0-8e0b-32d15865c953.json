Section   Sections  1,  2, 3, and 4 of the bill prohibits prohibit making, distributing, advertising, selling, promoting, completing, altering, or producing or causing to be made, distributed, advertised, sold, promoted, completed, altered, or produced a document that simulates or closely resembles an official document related to the administration of the motor vehicle or identification statutes. A person does not commit vehicular document piracy if the person received the express written permission of the department of revenue (department). A violation is punishable by a fine of not more than $1,000. Sections  2 and 3   5 and 6 make the \"Uniform Power of Attorney Act\" apply to the motor vehicle statutes. Section  4   7 repeals the requirement that a service-connected disability be permanent in order for a veteran to be eligible to register a motor vehicle without paying fees. Section  4   7 also repeals the license plates issued to foreign governments, consuls, or other official representatives of a foreign government. Section  5   8 repeals the Navy SEAL special license plate and the North American aerospace defense command special license plate, and section  6   9 repeals the \"Alive at Twenty-five\" special license plate.\nUnder current law, a minor who is under 18 years of age must submit a log showing the minor drove at least 50 hours with a driving supervisor to be issued a driver's license. Section  7   10 authorizes any responsible adult to sign the log. Section  8  11 corrects a provision that describes a minor as being 21 years of age or older. Section 12  repeals a provision that incorrectly states the length of time a person must agree to register a vehicle after moving to Colorado.\nUnder current law, the department may require a person to obtain a written medical opinion from certain medical professionals concerning medical criteria for driver licensing. Section  9   13 authorizes an advanced practice registered nurse to issue such an opinion. Section 14  authorizes the department to round fee increases to the nearest dollar.\nUnder current law, a person who is not lawfully present may, to obtain an identification document, use an identifying document issued by an agency of the United States government or its contractors or subcontractors in accordance with rules promulgated by the department, but this provision is scheduled to take effect on January 1, 2027. Section  10   15 changes this effective date to the earlier of January 1, 2027, or when the department is able to implement it. Section  11   16 authorizes the use of a mobile driver's license, which is an official electronic extension of a department-issued physical identification document, to verify age or identity. The provider of a mobile driver's license must comply with the standards adopted by department rule. The department is given rule-making authority to approve and implement mobile driver's licenses. Section  11   16 takes effect January 1, 2026. Section 17  authorizes the motor vehicle investigations unit (unit) to cancel, deny, or deny the issuance or reissuance of an official document upon determining that the person was not entitled to the issuance of the official document for:\n\n\nFailure to give the required or correct information in an application or for committing fraud in making the application or in submitting any proof for the application; or\nPermitting an unlawful or fraudulent use of the official document or for being convicted of an offense involving misuse of the official document.\n\nIf the unit cancels, denies, or denies the issuance or reissuance of an official document, the affected person may request a hearing.\n(Note: Italicized words indicate new material added to the original summary;
