Starting August 1, 2026, to provide private security services in the state:\n\n\nAn individual must obtain an event security officer or a commercial security officer license from the board; and\nA private security employer must obtain a registration from the board.\n\n\nAdditionally, only a licensed commercial security officer may be authorized to carry a firearm or nonlethal weapon and must first obtain a board-issued weapon endorsement to do so. Law enforcement officers who are certified by the peace officers standards and training board are exempt from the licensure and weapon endorsement requirements.\n\nThe bill establishes requirements and qualifications for obtaining a license, weapon endorsement, or registration, as applicable, including:\n\n\nObtaining a fingerprint-based criminal history record check to verify that the applicant has not committed a disqualifying criminal offense;\nCompleting specified training and successfully passing an assessment;\nSatisfying minimum age requirements; and\nFor an employer registration, having the requisite level of experience and professional liability insurance and a policy for training newly licensed employees.\n\n\nPending the results of the required criminal history record check, the board may issue an applicant a provisional license under specified circumstances that allows an otherwise qualified applicant to perform private security services under direct supervision and in limited spaces. The bill allows a private security officer who is licensed in a municipality in the state to obtain a state-issued license, without additional training, if the board determines that the municipal licensing requirements are substantially equivalent to the requirements in the bill.\n\nThe board is authorized to:\n\n\nAdopt rules;\nApprove training;\nIssue and renew licenses, weapon endorsements, and registrations and impose fees; and\nConduct investigations and hearings and impose discipline for violations of the bill.\n\n\nThe regulation of private security officers and private security employers is scheduled to repeal on September 1, 2030, and is subject to sunset review by the department before its repeal.\n(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "House Committee on Finance Postpone Indefinitely", "date": "2025-04-07T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "House Committee on Business Affairs & Labor Refer Unamended to Finance", "date": "2025-03-27T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Business Affairs & Labor", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Business Affairs & Labor", "date": "2025-02-18T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Business Affairs & Labor", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Javier Mabrey", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Javier Mabrey\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Mike Weissman", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Mike Weissman\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "N.
