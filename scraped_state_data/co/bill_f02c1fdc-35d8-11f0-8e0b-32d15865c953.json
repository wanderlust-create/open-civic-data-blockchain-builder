Section 2 of the bill extends a refundable income tax credit (credit) that is available for the income tax years commencing on January 1, 2022, and January 1, 2024, so that the credit is also available for the income tax years commencing on January 1, 2025, and January 1, 2026.\nFor each income tax year, the credit is for a qualifying senior, which means a resident individual who:\n\n\nIs 65 years of age or older at the end of the income tax year;\nHas federal adjusted gross income (AGI) that is less than or equal to $75,000 if filing a single return, or less than or equal to $125,000 if filing a joint return; and\nHas not claimed the senior property tax exemption for the property tax year that coincides with the income tax year.\n\n\nThe amount of the credit for both the 2025 and 2026 income tax years is:\n\n\n$800 for a qualifying senior filing a single return with federal AGI that is $25,000 or less. For every $500 of federal AGI above $25,000, the amount of the credit is reduced by $8.\n$800 for 2 taxpayers filing a joint return with federal AGI that is $25,000 or less. For every $500 of federal AGI above $25,000, the amount of the credit is reduced by $4.\n$400 for each taxpayer, in the case of 2 taxpayers who share the same primary residence, and may legally file a joint return but actually file separate returns and both claim the credit. For every $500 of federal AGI above $25,000, the amount of the credit is reduced by $4.\n\n\nNotwithstanding the income-based reductions in the allowable credit amount, a taxpayer who also qualifies for a property tax and rent assistance grant or heat assistance grant during the calendar year 2025 or 2026 is eligible to receive the full amount of the credit.\n Section 1 requires the property tax administrator to provide reports from counties related to taxpayers who are eligible for and actually claim the homestead property tax exemption.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Senate Committee on Appropriations Lay Over Unamended - Amendment(s) Failed", "date": "2025-05-08T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Committee on Finance Refer Amended to Appropriations", "date": "2025-01-28T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to Finance", "date": "2025-01-08T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Kyle Mullica", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Kyle Mullica\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Bob Marshall", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Bob Marshall\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Junie Joseph", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Junie Joseph\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "L.
