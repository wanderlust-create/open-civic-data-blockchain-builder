{"legislative_session": "2025A", "identifier": "SB25-275", "title": "Nonsubstantive Relocation of Definitions in Colorado Revised Statutes", "from_organization": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["bill"], "subject": [], "abstracts": [{"note": "summary", "abstract": "Statutory Revision Committee. The Colorado Revised Statutes are meant to be organized in such a way that a reader knows generally where to find information. Each title is broken up into articles, parts, and sections, and articles, parts, and sections often have definitions provisions. For parts and articles, readers expect to find those definitions at the beginning of each part or article.\nHowever, a number of definitions are \"hidden\" in the statutes, meaning a definition for an entire article, part, or title is not in a definitions section. Instead, the definition is one sentence of many in a section within the part or article. The purpose of the bill is to \"unhide\" these definitions by moving them into definitions sections where readers would expect to, and can more easily, find them.\n\nIn the bill, when a term is defined for a part or article and the term, in current law, is in its own subdivision, that entire provision is relocated to a new or existing definitions section. For example, section 4 of the bill relocates the definition of \"student election judge\" from section 1-6-101 (7)(b), Colorado Revised Statutes, to a newly created definitions section for article 6 of title 1, Colorado Revised Statutes. When a provision is relocated to a new or existing definitions section, the language in the current provision must be repealed, so that the 2 references don't simultaneously exist in statute. Section 338 repeals all the relocated provisions in the bill.\nWhen a term or phrase is defined for a part or article and the term in current law is embedded within another provision, the phrase containing the defined term is removed from that provision and the term is added to:\n\n\nA newly created definitions section for that part or article; or\nAn existing definitions section for that part or article.\n\n\nIn a very few instances, when definitions were moved, conforming amendments were needed, meaning that a reference to that definition in another section of law needed to be deleted or updated to reference the new definitions section. Sections 5, 6, 13, 29, 31, 128, 157, 182, 183, 206, 207, 218, 274, 279, and 292 are conforming amendments.(Note: This summary applies to the reengrossed version of this bill as introduced in the second house.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Sent to the Governor", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"executive\"}", "classification": ["executive-receipt"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the Speaker of the House", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Signed by the President of the Senate", "date": "2025-05-15T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Considered House Amendments - Result was to Concur - Repass", "date": "2025-05-01T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-30T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Special Order - Passed with Amendments - Committee", "date": "2025-04-29T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Second Reading Laid Over Daily - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-24T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "House Committee on State, Civic, Military, & Veterans Affairs Refer Amended to House Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-04-21T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage", "referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "House Committee of the Whole", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to State, Civic, Military, & Veterans Affairs", "date": "2025-04-14T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "State, Civic, Military, & Veterans Affairs", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Senate Third Reading Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-14T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["passage", "reading-3"], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Second Reading Special Order - Passed - No Amendments", "date": "2025-04-11T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": []}, {"description": "Senate Committee on State, Veterans, & Military Affairs Refer Unamended - Consent Calendar to Senate Committee of the Whole", "date": "2025-04-10T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["committee-passage"], "related_entities": [{"name": "State, Veterans, & Military Affairs", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In Senate - Assigned to State, Veterans, & Military Affairs", "date": "2025-04-03T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"upper\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "State, Veterans, & Military Affairs", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Matt Ball", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Matt Ball\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Marc Catlin", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Marc Catlin\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Stephanie Luck", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Stephanie Luck\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Cecelia Espenoza", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Cecelia Espenoza\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "L.
