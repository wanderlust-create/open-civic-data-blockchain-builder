Sections 3 and 4 prohibit a debt collector or debt collection agency from collecting or attempting to collect any debt that is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt unless the debt collector or debt collection agency first obtains a decree, judgment, or court order finding the debt was not the result of economic abuse or coerced debt.\nCurrent law requires a consumer reporting agency to reinvestigate a disputed item in the consumer's file free of charge. Sections 6 and 7 authorize a consumer reporting agency to reinvestigate an item that the consumer asserts is the result of economic abuse or coerced debt. Section 8 adds economic abuse and coerced debt to the definition of \"coercion\" as it relates to civil protection orders issued in cases of domestic violence.(Note: This summary applies to this bill as introduced.)"}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "House Committee on Appropriations Lay Over Unamended - Amendment(s) Failed", "date": "2025-05-13T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": [], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "House Committee on Finance Refer Unamended to Appropriations", "date": "2025-03-20T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Appropriations", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "House Committee on Judiciary Refer Amended to Finance", "date": "2025-03-12T06:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["referral-committee"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Finance", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Judiciary", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}, {"description": "Introduced In House - Assigned to Judiciary", "date": "2025-02-10T07:00:00+00:00", "organization_id": "~{\"classification\": \"lower\"}", "classification": ["introduction"], "related_entities": [{"name": "Judiciary", "entity_type": "organization", "organization_id": null}]}], "sponsorships": [{"name": "Ryan Armagost", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Ryan Armagost\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Mandy Lindsay", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"lower\", \"name\": \"Mandy Lindsay\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Lindsey Daugherty", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Lindsey Daugherty\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "Byron Pelton", "classification": "primary", "entity_type": "person", "primary": true, "person_id": "~{\"chamber\": \"upper\", \"name\": \"Byron Pelton\"}", "organization_id": null}, {"name": "M.
