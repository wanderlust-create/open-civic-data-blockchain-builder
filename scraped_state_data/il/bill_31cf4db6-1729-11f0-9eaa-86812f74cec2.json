Provides that beginning with the 2026-2027 school year, a school district shall provide informational materials about the Illinois Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) account program (rather than the Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) account program) annually to the parent or guardian of a student who has a section 504 Plan under the federal Rehabilitation Act of 1973, using the same distribution methods employed for other communications related to the student's section 504 Plan. Removes language providing that a school may transmit the informational material to a parent or guardian in the same manner as other documents and information related to an Individualized Education Program meeting are provided to the parent or guardian. Amends the Department of Early Childhood Act and the Early Intervention Services System Act. In provisions requiring individualized family service plans for children receiving early intervention services, provides that during the initial development of an individual family service plan and at each review meeting of the service plan, the regional intake offices shall provide the parent or guardian with informational materials about the Illinois (ABLE) account program. Requires the informational materials to include an overview of the Illinois ABLE account program, eligibility criteria, and other necessary enrollment information. Requires the Office of the State Treasurer to prepare and deliver the informational materials about the Illinois ABLE account for distribution to regional intake offices which shall subsequently disseminate the informational materials to parents and guardians in the same manner as they transmit other documents to families. Makes technical changes to the State Treasurer Act to change the name of the Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) account program to the Illinois Achieving a Better Life Experience (ABLE) account program."}], "other_titles": [], "other_identifiers": [], "actions": [{"description": "Filed with the Clerk by Rep.
