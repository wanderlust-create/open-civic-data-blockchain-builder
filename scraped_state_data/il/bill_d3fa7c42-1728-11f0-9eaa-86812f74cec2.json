Authorizes a credit union to furnish information to any person on a list submitted and periodically updated by a member who is an elderly person or person with a disability or to specified other persons, if there is suspicion by the credit union that the member has been or may become a victim of financial exploitation. Provides that the board of directors of a credit union with a composite rating of either 1 or 2 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System known as the CAMELS supervisory rating system and a management rating under such composite rating of either 1 or 2 may meet not less than 4 (instead of 6) times annually.

Permits the merger of credit unions, without meeting certain voting and notice requirements, where supervisory concerns exist and upon agreement of the boards of directors of the merging and continuing credit unions, as confirmed by a majority vote of the directors present at a meeting of each board at which a quorum is present.
