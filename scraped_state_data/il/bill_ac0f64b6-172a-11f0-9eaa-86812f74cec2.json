Authorizes a credit union to furnish information to any person on a list submitted and periodically updated by a member who is an elderly person or person with a disability or to specified other persons, if there is suspicion by the credit union that the member has been or may become a victim of financial exploitation. Provides that the board of directors of a credit union with a composite rating of either 1 or 2 under the Uniform Financial Institutions Rating System known as the CAMELS supervisory rating system and a management rating under such composite rating of either 1 or 2 may meet not less than 4 (instead of 6) times annually.
